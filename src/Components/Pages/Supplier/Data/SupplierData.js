It has a very smooth user experience which saves a lot of time. It helps us manage all our invoices, our suppliers and expenditures. It also gives an overview of the expenditures by suppliers, product, buyer, and activity which helps us set our future goals. I have not seen an option to link Claritum with our previous spend management tool or import the data from it. It would save us a lot of time and help us keep previous data in check. I'm still new and exploring the tool so maybe I have missed the option.",
