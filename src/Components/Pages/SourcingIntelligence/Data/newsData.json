      "News Intro": "The company will provide janitorial cleaning services spanning 4.8 million square feet of space across Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Deer Valley Airport and Goodyear Airport, it says.",
      "News Body": "Dive Brief:\nThe city of Phoenix has named ABM as the primary janitorial cleaning services provider for its three airports.\nThe five-year $25 million contract covers 4.8 million square feet of space across Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Deer Valley Airport and Goodyear Airport, according to a news release Tuesday. ABM will focus on improving operations and passenger experience, while driving environmentally sustainable practices, the company said.\nABM said that it is poised to meet and exceed Phoenix Sky Harbor’s short- and long-term sustainability goals through “innovative technologies and a dedicated team to deliver a five-star level of cleanliness” that can elevate overall travel experience. ABM provides cleaning services to a number of large domestic and international airports, creating a “clean, healthy and world-class experience for 28 of the top 30 busiest airports in the U.S.,” Sean Bromfield, president of aviation at ABM, said in the release.\nDive Insight:\nAirports are increasingly turning to technology integrations to meet day-to-day operational needs, improve cleanliness and facilitate upgrades, with airports, like the George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Chicago O’Hare International Airport, channeling funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law toward upgrading restrooms, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nThe three airports in Phoenix are significant economic engines for Arizona, ABM said in the release. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, for example, has an annual economic impact of over $38 billion and is funded with airport revenue rather than tax dollars, according to its website. Close to 49 million travelers pass through the airport, which has been dubbed “America’s friendliest airport,” each year, per the release. The moniker is a result of its “standards for cleanliness and customer satisfaction,” ABM said. \nABM says it provides integrated facility services, infrastructure solutions and parking management to over 20,000 clients across industries from commercial office buildings, government buildings and data centers to airports and hospitals. These services cover janitorial, engineering, electrical, lighting, energy and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, HVAC and mechanical, landscape and turf services and other mission-critical solutions, the firm said. \nThe company’s existing clients include LaGuardia Gateway Partners, the developer and manager of LaGuardia Airport Terminal B where it provides integrated facility services. Other ABM services that aim to improve passenger experience in airports include an integrated smart parking solution that can alleviate the process of finding guest parking in airports, according to a news release issued last April.\n“ABM’s proven track record in delivering best-in-class quality service that is data-enabled and integrated with airport operations,” Bromfield said in Tuesday’s release, noting a record-breaking number of passengers for the airports last year.",

      "News Body": "Mitie has been awarded a new £297 million contract with the Department for Transport (DfT) for seven years. Building on its existing 12-year relationship, Mitie will continue to provide integrated facilities management (IFM) services including cleaning, security, landscaping, planned and reactive building maintenance and energy management across DfT’s over 800 nationwide sites. This includes the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), the British Transport Police (BTP), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), High Speed 2 (HS2), and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).\nThe contract will see Mitie implement a range of new technologies to support DfT in meeting the Government’s Greening Commitment – a set of targets for central government departments to tackle carbon emissions. For example, Mitie will remotely monitor the building management systems (BMS) across DfT’s estate, meaning real-time data on the performance of building equipment, like heating and ventilation systems, will be analysed by Mitie’s expert engineers from afar. With engineers able to remotely identify any malfunctions or maintenance requirements that could be wasting energy, and make site visits only when necessary, remote maintenance is predicted to help DfT to cut up to 15% of its carbon usage. Mitie has also introduced an auto-flushing mechanism which remotely flushes little used outlets across buildings, maintaining water hygiene and cutting the number of necessary site visits.\nTo help deliver on DfT’s social value objectives, Mitie has committed to enrolling 5% of its full-time workforce on the contract onto apprenticeships. This aligns with Mitie’s own pledge to have 5% of its colleagues in earn-and-learn positions as a member of the 5% Club. Also, a quarter of new hires on the contract will come through the Mitie Foundation, Mitie’s independent charity supporting those facing barriers to employment.\nJason Towse, Managing Director of Business Services, Mitie said:\n“We’re pleased to be continuing our 12-year partnership with DfT with this new contract. With our innovative approach to facilities transformation, we look forward to supporting the important public services DfT provides and accelerating the department on its path to net zero by integrating carbon emission cutting technology.”",

      "News Intro": "Clariant is excited to present the company’s latest portfolio of products for the health care industry at the upcoming CPHI tradeshow in Milan, Italy, on October 8 through 10, 2024.",
      "News Body": "Clariant is excited to present the company’s latest portfolio of products for the health care industry at the upcoming CPHI tradeshow in Milan, Italy, on October 8 through 10, 2024.\r\n\r\n“We’ve built on our proven track record by supporting the development and production of pharmaceuticals with a broader portfolio of solutions for the industry’s growing technologies, such as the injectables segment. With our new excipients, we address the market’s need for low endotoxin and highly purified solubilizers,” comments Vaios Barlas, Global Head of Health Care at Clariant.\r\n\r\nClariant introduces VitiPure™ LEX 3350 S, VitiPure LEX 4000 S, and Polyglykol 1450 S to solve active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) delivery and bioavailability challenges\r\nThe VitiPure LEX product line has been designed for customers who require stringent control of the microbial load in their formulations. These co-solvents have been optimized for sensitive applications, as well as for the safe use with a variety of APIs, including those with low water solubility.\r\n\r\nVitiPure LEX 3350 S and VitiPure LEX 4000 S not only surpass the general pharmacopoeia monograph requirements, but they have also been risk-assessed in their production for their use as excipients in parenteral applications. In addition to the general monograph requirements, specific microbiological aspects have also been certified.\r\n\r\nPolyglykol 1450 S is an alternative polyethylene glycol co-solvent specified according to the current USP-NF monograph, which is additionally meeting the monoethylene and diethylene glycol limits recommended by the corresponding FDA guideline on this topic. Polyglykol 1450 S is produced under IPEC GMP conditions in the form of flakes, which allows easier handling during production. This product surpasses current international pharmacopeia requirements.\r\n\r\nNew launch of VitiPure CO 35 Superior (Polyoxyl 35 Castor Oil), VitiPure O 80 Superior (Polysorbate 80), and VitiPure L 20 Superior (Polysorbate 20) for colorless and parenteral applications with the highest purity excipients\r\nThe VitiPure Superior line offers nearly colorless excipients and hence adds no color to the final formulation due to its ultra-low residual impurities. Additionally, this line is suitable for APIs that are sensitive to residual impurities and for formulations that require low microbial loads with low endotoxins. VitiPure Superior products are highly-purified excipients, suitable for parenteral formulations. VitiPure CO 35 Superior is addressing the parenteral application where the highest purity of the excipient is required (e.g., Paclitaxel, Phytomenadione, Valrubicin, Ciclosporin, Ixabepilone, Plitidespin, Teniposide, and Utidelone). VitiPure O 80 Superior and VitiPure L 20 Superior are additionally appropriate for the stabilization of human and veterinary vaccines and biologics.\r\n\r\nCompared to the standard excipient grade, all three Superior products improve the stability of the finished API formulations. In addition, the steel packaging with nitrogen purging assures low levels of peroxide formation during product storage.\r\n\r\nNew VitiPure Meglumine LEX for sensitive formulations\r\nClariant has developed Meglumine for sensitive formulations where both a low bioburden and low endotoxin grade are required (microbial load: endotoxin max. 1.5 IU/g, TAMC max. 50 cfu/g, TYMC max. 10 cfu/g). This solubilizer can be used as a counter-ion in contrast media (as an alternative to sodium), a buffering agent, and a bioavailability and solubility enhancer of mildly acidic APIs. Due to its low microbial load, Meglumine LEX is suitable for parenteral applications.\r\n\r\nVitiPure HCO is a new hydrogenated castor oil (HCO) in powder form for solid oral and topical use\r\nClariant has developed VitiPure HCO for tablet formulations as a lubricant or sustained-release agent (e.g., for APIs such as Clopidogrel, Benazepril, Misoprostol, Ropinirole, Felodipine, Diclofenac, Hydrochlorothiazide, Tadafil, Cefuroxime, etc.). Additionally, VitiPure HCO is suitable as a consistency factor for topical formulations (e.g., for APIs such as Lidocaine, Prilocaine, Betamethasone, Calcipotriene, Urea, Tacalcitol, Hydrocortisone, Minocycline, Glycyrrhetinic acid, etc.). The consistent particle size distribution is well-suited as a tablet lubricant for applications where a hydrophobic lubricant is needed or as a replacement of magnesium stearate. Therefore, this product is suitable for processing through direct compression or dry granulation.\r\n\r\nClariant is committed to providing strong quality assurance and robust regulatory support for its customers.

      "News Body": "In June 2024, the German market for Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 200 grade) observed significant variations, exhibiting broader trends within the manufacturing sector. The price of Polyethylene Glycol decreased by 1.5% from May, closing the month at USD 1,320 per metric ton. This price movement is expressive of the current economic scenario and sector-specific dynamics affecting the market of Polyethylene Glycol.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the price of Polyethylene Glycol can be ascribed to various factors. June saw a sharp fall in purchasing activity among manufacturers, who were keenly working to lower their pre-production inventories. This approach was part of a broader effort to control costs amid diminishing demand for Polyethylene Glycol. The destocking cycle, which had been constant, showed no signs of decreasing, with manufacturers stating growing declines in both pre- and post-production inventories of Polyethylene Glycol.\r\n\r\nThe broader economic situation also played a significant role. The German manufacturing sector faced a new setback at the end of the second quarter. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indicated a decrease, reflecting a reacceleration in the rates of contraction in both output and new orders, which had reduced extensively in May. The decline in new orders was determined by weaker domestic demand and reduced export orders from other European markets and China, impacting the Polyethylene Glycol market. Export sales fell at a faster rate, although this decline was less pronounced than the overall reduction in new orders of Polyethylene Glycol.\r\n\r\nThe Polyethylene Glycol market in Germany also felt the impact of reduced input costs and factory gate charges. Despite the downward pressure on prices, the rate of decline in input costs eased slightly, suggesting a complex interplay of supply and demand factors affecting Polyethylene Glycol. The reduced demand for inputs contributed to an improvement in supplier delivery times, though this improvement was less marked than in previous months.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the sentiment among manufacturers showed a slight improvement, with expectations for growth in the year ahead becoming more optimistic. This optimism was augmented by hopes of a recovery in exports, increased investment, and a general improvement in economic conditions. However, the immediate outlook for the Polyethylene Glycol market remains prudent, as manufacturers continue to navigate the challenges of declining demand and ongoing inventory adjustments.\r\n\r\nIn summary, June 2024 was a difficult month for the Polyethylene Glycol market in Germany. The price decline reflected broader economic trends, including reduced manufacturing output, lower new orders, and ongoing destocking efforts. While the sentiment among manufacturers showed signs of improvement, the polyethylene glycol market remained under pressure from weak demand both domestically and internationally. The future outlook hinges on potential recoveries in export markets and increased investment, which might support the Polyethylene Glycol market in the coming months.",

      "News Body": "Evonik and the University of Mainz have signed a license agreement to commercialize randomized polyethylene glycols (rPEGs), a new class of PEGs. Evonik intends to use rPEGs for its platform of specialized lipids and commercialize the excipients under the license agreement to meet customer and market needs. Technical grade rPEG-lipids will be available in the second half of 2024.\r\n\r\nAs part of the company’s Nutrition & Care life sciences division, Evonik’s Health Care business has been growing its nucleic acid drug and vaccine delivery portfolio by leveraging its biosolutions, and innovation and co-creation opportunities with life science leaders. By partnering with the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany, where rPEGs were first developed, Evonik is able to offer its customers an expanded toolbox of technologies for nucleic acid-based medicines.\r\n\r\n“When scientists at the University of Mainz approached us with their groundbreaking work on rPEGs, we immediately recognized the potential for broader formulation options and the benefits this could bring our customers,” said Thomas Riermeier, head of the Health Care business line at Evonik.\r\n\r\nPolyethylene glycols (PEGs) are polymers that have been used in the pharmaceutical industry for more than 30 years to improve the bioavailability, stability, targeting and performance of therapeutics. rPEG polymers have similar properties to PEGs but have a different structure that is intended to offer an improved immunogenicity profile.

      "News Title": "UVA Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Collaboration Offers Hope for Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients",
      "News Intro": "Using a new recipe for growing blood vessels from living lung tissue in the lab, a University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science research team has developed an analytical tool that could lead to a cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, a lung-destroying disease. ",
      "News Body": "Using a new recipe for growing blood vessels from living lung tissue in the lab, a University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science research team has developed an analytical tool that could lead to a cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, a lung-destroying disease. \r\n\r\nFibrosis is chronic scarring of tissue and it can strike nearly every system in the body. According to the National Institutes of Health, the government estimates that 45% of deaths in the United States can be attributed to fibrotic disorders. In the lungs, fibrosis restricts breathing, so understanding how scarring occurs, and ultimately how to stop it, are essential questions — especially in the case of IPF, a form of pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause. \r\n\r\nIn search of answers, assistant professor of chemical engineering Lakeshia J. Taite is leading a team in collaboration with Shayn M. Peirce-Cottler and biomedical engineering Ph.D. student Julie Leonard-Duke in Peirce-Cottler's lab. Peirce-Cottler is the chair of biomedical engineering and Harrison Distinguished Teaching Professor. \r\n\r\nTheir work combines computational models of how blood vessels behave in the fibrotic lung developed by Leonard-Duke in Peirce-Cottler's lab with experiments using hydrogels engineered in Taite's lab. The result is a new investigative platform for studying the formation of blood vessels — a process called angiogenesis. \r\n\r\nTaite and Pierce-Cottler want to understand the role of angiogenesis — a natural part of tissue repair after injury — when the lungs won't stop trying to heal, turning pliant tissue stiff and fibrous until they no longer function. \r\nThe research was published in Microcirculation, whose editors selected a figure from the paper to feature on the cover of the August 2023 issue. \r\nThis image shows vascular sprouting from mouse lung tissue planted on a hydrogel.\r\nThis image shows vascular sprouting from mouse lung tissue planted on a hydrogel.\r\nThe image shows vascular sprouting from mouse lung tissue planted on a hydrogel, a water-swollen biomaterial that resembles a soft contact lens. Taite's lab functionalizes these hydrogels with bioactive molecules that closely mimic the angiogenic signals that encourage blood vessel development. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this functionality, Taite's team chemically couples specific peptides — strings of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins — with derivatives of polyethylene glycol, a common off-the-shelf crystalline polymer, to form a PEG-peptide conjugate. The peptides are either purchased or made using a programmable synthesizer. \r\n\r\nThis multistep process produces a fluffy white powder akin to store-bought gelatin mix. Dissolved in a water-based solution and exposed to ultraviolet light, the molecules crosslink to form a soft but solid material that mouse lung cells planted on the surface can interact with, triggering new cell growth. \r\n\r\n\"The hydrogel was tailored to have mechanical properties — for example, stiffness and elasticity — matching healthy lung tissue,\" Taite said. \"The hydrogel acts as the vascular cells' native extracellular matrix, the complex mixture of proteins, carbohydrates and minerals that provide important cues for tissue development and maintenance.\"\r\n\r\nThe broad goal of the project is to understand the biomechanical and biochemical cues to blood vessels in the lungs during the development and progression of fibrosis. The team is building laboratory modeling systems to accelerate the search for treatments to stop IPF in its tracks. \r\n\r\n\"This project represents a novel angiogenesis assay that allows investigation of matrix stiffness on microvascular sprouting,\" Taite said. \r\n\r\nTaite began the research just after her arrival at UVA in 2021, using her experimental techniques with Leonard-Duke's computer models to validate and improve the models, which in turn inform Taite's experiments.\r\n\r\n\"We incorporate data from this sprouting assay into our computer models which simulate the complex cell behaviors contributing to lung fibrosis,\" Leonard-Duke said. \"We then use artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to comprehensively explore the genes and proteins that could be targets for new drugs.\" \r\n\r\nAlso contributing to the research were Anthony C. Bruce, biomedical engineering lab manager and a co-author of the paper, Samuel Agro, a now second-year chemical engineering Ph.D. student in Taite's lab, and Yixuan Yuan, who graduated with his B.S. in chemical engineering in spring 2023. \r\n\r\nAgro and Leonard-Duke are working on a continuation of the project.

      "News Intro": "Clariant today unveils its new Vita 100% bio-based surfactants and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) to help directly address climate change by helping remove fossil carbon from the value chain.",
      "News Body": "Clariant today unveils its new Vita 100% bio-based surfactants and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) to help directly address climate change by helping remove fossil carbon from the value chain.\r\n\r\nAs our climate gives us increasing and alarming signals of change, individuals and industries are looking for ways to reduce their environmental footprints, and the demand for bio-based chemicals is set to grow strongly in the coming years. Clariant is committed to fostering the transition to a more sustainable bioeconomy and has a growing share of bio-based products and processing aids in its portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of 100% bio-based surfactants and PEGs significantly expands Clariant’s Vita designated ingredients. Vita products are based on renewable feedstocks and have at least 98% Renewable Carbon Index (RCI). It is just one example of its commitment to provide low carbon footprint solutions to customers and to Greater Chemistry – between people and planet.\r\n\r\n“From the packaging to the many ingredients, a typical consumer product in coatings, personal care, home care, industrial, and agricultural applications still uses petrochemicals and therefore fossil carbon,” said Christian Vang, Global Head of Business Unit Industrial & Consumer Specialties, Clariant. “Switching to bio-based carbon chemistry remains a big challenge for manufacturers and by launching the Vita surfactant and PEG range we are offering them an important new solution to achieve this.”\r\n\r\nDesigned for natural formulations targeting a high Renewable Carbon Index (RCI), the new Vita products support manufacturers in maximizing the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoo, paint, industrial lubricants, and crop formulations.\r\n\r\nClariant uses 100% bio-ethanol derived from sugar cane or corn to create the ethylene oxide for its innovative new surfactants and PEGs. The bio-based material is fully segregated along the value chain from the field to the final consumer product.\r\n\r\nBecause only bio-based feedstocks are used, the ingredients have significantly lower carbon footprints than their fossil-based counterparts. The Vita surfactants are CO₂ emissions savers: they can help save up to 85% of CO₂ emissions[1] compared to their fossil analogues.\r\n\r\nImportantly, in addition to setting the standard in a greener production, these new solutions are chemically equivalent to Clariant’s fossil versions, offering the same performance and efficiency to formulators and brand owners. Customers can currently benefit from more than 70 bio-based products, and the range will continue to be expanded to meet evolving market needs. In Q1 2022, double-digit kilotons of the bio-based surfactants and PEGs will be available for the worldwide business segments from Clariant IGL Specialty Chemicals (CISC), a Clariant joint venture.\r\n\r\nAs one of the global leader in specialty chemicals, and a member of the UN Global Compact, Clariant is at the forefront of advanced carbon solutions with a unique level of expertise, know-how and industry knowledge .

      "News Body": "DHL Group, the world's leading logistics company, has introduced its strategic framework for the second half of the decade. With “Strategy 2030 – Accelerate Sustainable Growth” the company aims for 50% revenue growth by 2030 compared to 2023.\r\nThe Group’s business divisions will continue to focus on their profitable core businesses stimulating growth through service excellence. DHL Group aims to unlock its full growth potential through divisional and group growth initiatives. The company will accelerate sustainable growth through its group growth initiatives focusing on structural tailwinds in fast-growing geographies and industry sectors, as well as the megatrend of e-commerce.\r\n\r\nDHL Group will also improve customer experience at digital touchpoints. With Strategy 2030, DHL Group is furthermore reinforcing its commitment to decarbonization and aims to align legal and management structures to ensure a lean divisional set-up.\r\n\r\nTobias Meyer, CEO of DHL Group, said in a statement, “We are ideally positioned to seize growth opportunities in a rapidly changing world thanks to our well-balanced, diversified portfolio. We want to grow faster and more profitably while decarbonizing our business. We will fortify our market-leading position in global logistics with a strong focus on quality and on servicing the needs of fast-growing industry segments\".\r\n\r\n“Strategy 2025” navigated DHL Group through turbulent times\r\nOver the past five years, \"Strategy 2025 – Delivering Excellence in a Digital World\" has effectively navigated DHL Group through global challenges including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions. DHL Group achieved major advancements along the three proven bottom lines employer, provider, and investment of choice as well as in its ESG Roadmap goals introduced in 2021.\r\n\r\nAccelerated growth from fast-growing industry sectors and geographies as well as e-commerce and digitalization\r\n\r\nIn a complex and volatile environment, the logistics sector is changing as well. Geopolitical tensions are reshaping the global trade landscape. Companies are actively working to create more resilient supply chains. Moreover, the fight against climate change and demographic shifts in the workforce contribute to additional complexity. While these industry changes present new challenges, DHL Group's strong track record and global footprint position it uniquely to seize significant opportunities for additional growth. DHL aims to leverage its strengths and accelerate growth with the following Group growth initiatives, which will boost growth in addition to the growth agendas of the five divisions:\r\n\r\nLife Sciences & Healthcare\r\nDHL Group is strongly positioned to address structural shifts in the pharma market, which depends on specialized logistics solutions such as temperature-controlled frozen or cryogenic storage. The biopharma, cell & gene, and clinical trials market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of >10% p.a. between 2023 and 2030 and thus significantly above global GDP.\r\n\r\nNew Energy\r\nThe transformation of the renewable energy and auto-mobility sectors requires dedicated logistics solutions, e.g., handling windmill blades or battery energy storage systems. An expected CAGR of >15% p.a. between 2023 and 2030 offers DHL Group significant growth potential.\r\n\r\nGeographic Tailwinds\r\nDHL Group will build on its strong global footprint and local expertise to double down on geographic tailwinds. This addresses the profound shift in growth of trade lanes, diversification of global supply chains, and the needs of fast-growing companies around the world.\r\n\r\nE-commerce\r\nThe megatrend e-commerce has been a steady growth driver for DHL Group in recent years. DHL Group will enhance its footprint in the e-commerce market by using the combined strength of its divisions for integrated offerings, such as combined fulfillment and last-mile delivery. The global e-commerce market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% p.a. until 2030.\r\n\r\nDigital Sales\r\nDHL Group expects digital sales capabilities to become a standard to gain and retain customers. Therefore, the Group will further expand its digital sales program to create enhanced online transactions for the customers across the Group.\r\n\r\nSustainability\r\nAs a global logistics company with the goal of decarbonizing its business by 2050, DHL Group integrates sustainability into its existing strategic “three bottom lines” framework as the fourth strategic bottom line named “Green Logistics of Choice”. The company aims to use its expertise to support customers in decarbonizing their supply chains, thereby gaining shares in this evolving market. Corresponding initiatives include strategic partnerships and intensifying decarbonization efforts to secure among other things a 30% blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030.\r\n\r\n\"We take pride in maintaining the largest fleet of electric vehicles in the logistics industry and in achieving the highest share of SAF among all airlines globally in 2023. Investing in low emission logistics, which anticipate future market demand, will materialize into a competitive advantage as these transport solutions are becoming increasingly important to our customers,” said Tobias Meyer, CEO of DHL Group.\r\n\r\nTo reduce complexity and support its growth agenda, DHL Group aims to align its complex legal structure with its proven management structure. While the company’s management structure with its five divisions – Express, Global Forwarding/Freight, Supply Chain, eCommerce, and Post & Parcel Germany – is simple and clear, the underlying legal structure is much more complex and partially overlapping. The alignment intends to reduce complexity and create a more flexible and agile set-up.\r\n",

      "News Title": "DSV wins €14.3 billion acquisition of DB Schenker in a move to elevate global logistics reach and capabilities",
      "News Intro": "Danish logistics giant DSV has clinched a definitive agreement to purchase Deutsche Bahn’s logistics arm, DB Schenker, for €14.3 billion ($15.9 billion). This acquisition marks the largest in DSV’s history and promises to enhance its global reach to new markets and provide long-term growth, job creation and modernisation of workplaces.",
      "News Body": "Amid recent speculation that DSV was ahead of equity fund CVC in the race to acquire DB Schenker, DSV has now confirmed it has reached a definitive agreement to purchase the logistics provider.\r\n\r\nThe merger will create a logistics network with an expected pro forma revenue of around €39.3 billion ($43.6 billion) – based on 2023 figures – and a combined workforce of approximately 147,000 employees across more than 90 countries. The move is expected to enhance DSV’s competitive edge and expand its market presence within the logistics industry.\r\n\r\nRegarding impact on the automotive sector, Daniel Harrison, Automotive Analyst, Automotive Logistics, commented: “We know that the automotive logistics sector is currently too fragmented to be efficient. We therefore expect to see further consolidation and strategic acquisitions within the automotive logistics sector over the coming years.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the European Automotive Logistics Report 2024-2034, DSV’s total division revenues in 2023 were €19.6 billion ($21.7 billion) at the time the report was prepared, with an estimated annual revenue of €0.6 billion ($0.66 billion) from European automotive inbound logistics. DB Schenker, meanwhile, had total division revenues of €20.2 billion ($22.4 billion), with an estimated annual revenue of €0.64 billion ($0.7 billion) from European automotive inbound logistics.\r\n\r\n“There is an increasing focus on improving automotive logistics – both inbound and vehicle logistics – to enhance cost competitiveness and ultimately reduce total cost of vehicles,” Harrison continued. ”Developing more integrated end-to-end solutions will be a key part of addressing these challenges.\r\n\r\n “In this context, the DSV acquisition of DB Schenker therefore makes perfect sense to complement its existing logistics services and fulfil its overall strategy.”\r\n\r\nStrengthening global reach and capabilities\r\nWith the integration of Schenker’s network and expertise, DSV aims to develop its service offering across three of its key divisions: Air & Sea, Road and Solutions. Jens Lund, CEO of DSV, shared: “This is a transformative event in DSV’s history, and we are very excited to join forces with Schenker. Together, we are creating a world-leading transport and logistics powerhouse that will benefit our employees, customers and shareholders.”\r\n\r\nHarrison noted that the acquisition aligns with DSV’s strategy to address the volatility in container shipping rates experienced over recent years. He explained: “DSV’s pursuit of this acquisition reflects its aim to diversify beyond shipping. For example, other key bidders, such as Maersk for example, have stated that they want to expand their land-based logistics operations. Furthermore, many shipping companies want to develop more integrated, and end-to-end solutions, particularly within the automotive logistics space to capture more of this business.”\r\n\r\nGermany will play a pivotal role in the future of the newly formed entity. DSV plans to invest approximately $1 billion in Germany over the next three to five years, focusing on long-term growth, job creation and modernising workplaces. The integration will see significant operations and central functions remaining in Germany, particularly at Schenker’s Essen location. DSV anticipates that within five years the combined workforce in Germany will surpass the current employee numbers of both companies.\r\n\r\nVoices from the leadership\r\nJochen Thewes, CEO of Schenker, expressed enthusiasm about the merger: “Together with DSV, our goal is to transform the [logistics] industry and build a truly global market leader with joint European roots for the benefit of our employees and customers.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Richard Lutz, CEO of Deutsche Bahn, lauded the deal as a historic milestone: “The sale of DB Schenker to DSV marks the largest transaction in DB’s history and provides our logistics subsidiary with clear growth prospects. It has been important for us to find a strong partner for Schenker and a long-term home for the employees of the company.”\r\n\r\nThe transaction is pending approvals from Deutsche Bahn’s Supervisory Board and the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, with regulatory clearances expected by Q2 2025. DSV plans to finance the deal through a combination of equity and debt financing.\r\n\r\nUntil the deal is finalised, DSV and Schenker will continue to operate as separate entities, maintaining their current business operations. DSV shared the integration process will be a collaborative effort, with a focus on ensuring a smooth transition and upholding the high standards for which both companies are known.",

      "News Body": "Tata Steel today successfully commissioned India’s largest blast furnace at Kalinganagar, Odisha. With a total investment of Rs 27,000 crore, the Phase II expansion at Kalinganagar will take the total capacity at the site from 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 8 MTPA. The new facility was inaugurated by T. V. Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel, in the presence of senior leaders of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe new blast furnace will significantly boost the plant's overall production capabilities, allowing Tata Steel to meet the growing demands of various industries, including automotive, infrastructure, power, shipbuilding, and defence. It will also provide advantages in specific areas like oil & gas, lifting & excavation, and construction.\r\n\r\nWith the Phase II expansion, Odisha has emerged as the largest investment destination in India for Tata Steel, with a total cumulated investment of over Rs 100,000 crore in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, T. V. Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, Tata Steel, said:\"The commissioning of India’s largest blast furnace at Kalinganagar is a momentous occasion for the steel industry, setting new benchmarks in capacity, technology, and sustainability. A key enabler of socio-economic development in the region, the expansion not only strengthens Tata Steel's position as a leader in high-end, value-added steel segments but also showcases our advanced engineering prowess. It underscores our commitment to boosting private investment in India, aligning with the nation's vision for self-reliance and sustainable industrial growth. On behalf of Tata Steel, I thank the Government of Odisha for their unwavering support and applaud the collective efforts of our employees, suppliers & vendor partners, and all other stakeholders in enabling this significant milestone.”\r\n\r\nThe new blast furnace, with a volume of 5,870 m3, is equipped with state-of-the-art features for long campaign life and an eco-friendly design to optimise the steelmaking process. This blast furnace will utilise four top combustion stoves, a first in India, along with two preheating stoves for optimum specific fuel consumption in hot metal production. In a first for Tata Steel, a dry gas cleaning plant has been installed to maximise energy recovery from by-product gas. The world’s largest Top Gas Recovery Turbine (TRT) of 35 MW power generation capacity will help with the recovery of an additional 10% of energy. An evaporative cooling system is being employed for the first time in an Indian blast furnace, optimising space footprint while lowering specific water and power consumption by approximately 20% compared to conventional designs. The blast furnace will also have a zero-process water discharge plan with rainwater harvesting.\r\n\r\nKey facilities in Phase II expansion at Kalinganagar also include a Pellet Plant, Coke Plant, and Cold Rolling Mill, each incorporating advanced technologies and sustainable practices. The new state-of-the-art steel plant incorporates modern technologies focused on value-added products, operational efficiency, and a significant reduction in carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nThe Kalinganagar plant is not just an industrial complex; it is a key contributor to the socio-economic development of the region. Tata Steel has invested significantly in community development programmes that focus on education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities, positively impacting over 2 lakh people in the surrounding areas. The success of Tata Steel Kalinganagar is also deeply rooted in its workforce. Tata Steel’s ‘Safety First’ culture ensures that the highest safety standards are maintained, making Kalinganagar one of the safest steel plants in the country and the world.\r\n\r\nTata Steel Kalinganagar is the first Indian manufacturing plant to be named a Global Lighthouse by the World Economic Forum (WEF). In 2024, the Kalinganagar plant also received the prestigious ResponsibleSteelTM Certification, marking a significant milestone in its sustainability journey.\r\n",

The latest plans almost double a previous announcement earlier this year to spend $1.4 billion on other improvements through 2026, increasing the total to $2.7 billion.",
      "News Body": "On August 29, Nippon Steel Co. announced that it would spend an extra $1.3 billion on investments in two US Steel Co. plants once its attempt to purchase US Steel for $14 billion goes through. The latest plans almost double a previous announcement earlier this year to spend $1.4 billion on other improvements through 2026, increasing the total to $2.7 billion.\r\n\r\nBut despite the promises, Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel remains contentious, with the United Steelworkers and several prominent U.S. politicians opposed to the purchase of the one-time U.S. metals giant by a foreign company.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, Nippon Steel Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori said the latest investments would allow Nippon Steel to continue operating the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Gary, Indiana, plants.\r\n\r\n“We are excited to build upon the strong steelmaking legacy in the Mon Valley and Gary for the benefit of all stakeholders and the American steel industry for generations to come,” said Mori.\r\n\r\nThe latest promised investments would see $1 billion go towards increasing high-grade steel capacity at the Pittsburgh plant and the other $300 million towards extending the production life of one of the Gary plant’s blast furnaces. That’s in addition to $1.4 billion in “maintenance and other necessary capital investments” Nippon announced for US Steel properties in March.\r\nThe money is contingent, however, on the Japanese steel company actually acquiring US Steel. Despite reaching a deal with the U.S. company in late 2023, Nippon Steel’s $14 billion offer has fallen under political and regulatory scrutiny. The union representing US Steel’s workers and both major presidential candidates are against the deal.\r\n\r\nThe United Steelworkers favor the company’s purchase by Ohio-based rival Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. instead of Nippon Steel. In an August 28 statement, the union’s president, David McCall, noted that the promised funds from Nippon Steel are not binding.\r\n\r\n“A press release is not a contract,” he said, and called for Nippon Steel to “answer to pressing concerns regarding our critical supply chains and national security.”\r\n\r\nIn January, former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump opposed the deal in remarks made after meeting with the head of the Teamsters labor union. Trump, who favored aggressive tariff policies during his time in office, said he would “block it instantaneously.”\r\n\r\nAnd on Labor Day, his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, reiterated President Biden’s stance against the purchase. At a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, she said “US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.”\r\n\r\nFor its own part, Nippon Steel has cast its agreement to purchase U.S. Steel as a way of hindering the Japanese and U.S. steel industry’s largest rival, China.\r\n\r\nIn March, a day after President Joe Biden commented that US Steel should remain domestically owned, the Tokyo-based metals company said in a release that the planned acquisition would “strengthen American supply chains and economic defenses against China.”\r\n\r\n“No other U.S. steel company on its own can meet this challenge while also meeting antitrust requirements,” the company added, additionally promising the United Steel Workers there would be “no layoffs or plant closures until September 2026 under some conditions.”\r\n\r\nThe industrial dominance of China is a concern for Nippon Steel even in its home country. On August 30, Vice Chairman Mori said Japan should adopt similar trade policies to the United States and Europe to restrict Chinese steel imports.",

      "News Body": "South Korea’s largest steelmaker, POSCO, has unveiled a pilot steelmaking plant that runs on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels. This is reported by KED Global.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the South Korean company is moving towards its carbon neutrality ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe pilot plant at the Pohang facility has a production capacity of 24 tons of molten iron per day, emitting 400 kg of carbon per ton, which is significantly lower than at existing fossil fuel-based steel mills. The company expects the facility to become carbon-free after the transition to renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThe production process uses the HyREX hydrogen reduction process.\r\n\r\n«Carbon neutrality is not an obstacle, but an opportunity for the steel sector,» said POSCO Senior Vice President Bae Jin-Chang, who is in charge of the project.\r\n\r\nIn April 2024, the company succeeded in producing molten iron at the HyREX pilot plant, which was then undergoing repairs to improve post-process quality and develop additional technologies. Initial analysis showed that post-process quality, such as carbon specific gravity, did not meet POSCO’s standards.\r\n\r\nPosco plans to start construction of the full-scale HyREX steel plant with a production capacity of 36 tons of iron per hour in early 2025, with completion scheduled for 2027.\r\n\r\nThe company intends to produce 2.5 million tons of steel per year using this process by 2040, and to switch to hydrogen-based production by 2050.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, POSCO began construction of a 2.5 million tonne per annum electric arc furnace at its Gwangyang plant. It is planned to be completed by the end of 2025, and the official operation of the EAF will begin in 2026. When the planned production volume is achieved, the company will be able to reduce carbon emissions by about 3.5 million tons per year compared to blast furnace production.",

      "News Title": "Supply of steel to Indian auto industry to get major boost after ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel's Hazira expansion",
      "News Intro": "ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, a leading integrated flat steel producer in the country, currently has a crude steel capacity of about 9 million tonnes per annum and a pellet capacity of about 20 million.",
      "News Body": "ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, a joint venture between steel giants ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel will include a new 2 million tonne cold rolling mill and an upstream hot strip mill, targeting the fast-growing automotive sector with specialty steel grades, at its flagship plant in Hazira, Gujarat.  \r\n\r\nRanjan Dhar, Director and VP, Sales and Marketing, said that ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India was launching a new automotive line, with the plant currently under construction. The company is currently in expansion mode and aims to target 15 MTPA from the current 9 MTPA –  with an estimated investment of Rs 60,000 crore. The new cold rolling mill, specifically designed for automobiles, will produce all the specialty steel varieties offered globally by both companies. \r\n\r\n\"Considering the global landscape for automotive steel, there are only 3-4 major companies. Two of those companies – ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel – are in this joint venture,\" Dhar added. \"So I think its sufficient to say that we are bringing to India the best technologies and products that are available globally for the automotive industry.\"\r\n\r\nArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, a leading integrated flat steel producer in the country, currently has a crude steel capacity of about 9 million tonnes per annum and a pellet capacity of about 20 million. In the passenger vehicle segment, the company's share currently stands around 7-8%, which it intends to increase \"significantly\"  over the next five years. \"Our emphasis is that as these new capacities will come early next year, technically, there should not be any need for any imports,\" Dhar emphasised.\r\n\r\nSurge in demand for high performance steel \r\n\r\nThis move comes as India's auto industry experiences a surge in demand for high-performance steel, which now forms around 60% of the total body structure in today's vehicles. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India's expansion aims to capitalise on this trend, offering vehicle manufacturers a domestic source of advanced steel materials, with industry captains estimating the specialty steel segment to grow at a CAGR of 7-8%. \r\n\r\nCiting industry trends, Ranjan Dhar, Director and VP, Sales and Marketing at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, told Autocar Professional that the demand for automotive steel is rising alongside a decline in dependence on imports, which has fallen to 10-12%, down from around 35-38% 'few years ago'. \"As new capacities are added, including ours at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, we're introducing all the products currently being imported to provide complete solutions domestically,\" Dhar informed, adding that around 15% of the company's total steel production revenue comes from the automotive segment.\r\n\r\nLakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, while speaking at the inaugural session of the 10th edition of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January had mentioned stated that the first phase of the Hazira expansion plant is likely to see completion by 2026 it will be further expanded in multiple phases, to make it a 24 MTPA steel plant – thus becoming the world's largest steel plant. The second phase will be completed by 2029, Autocar Professional had reported earlier.\r\n\r\nArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India's upcoming expansion next year will include a new cold rolling mill and an auto plant specifically designed for electric vehicle (EV) steel production, keeping up with the shift towards electric mobility.  \r\n\r\nArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India is already engaging with auto companies developing new EVs for the Indian and global markets, Dhar noted. This gains importance in the context of the unavailability of specific varieties of electrical steel in India. Limited availability of these specialised steels forces auto companies to design vehicles with import dependence in mind. Conversely, having all the necessary steel varieties readily available in India will encourage design innovation in the sector. \r\n\r\nSpecialised steel to make Indian auto exports competitive \r\n\r\nBetting on the India growth story, Dhar remarked that, both commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle demand in India has been growing. Although CV demand tends to be more cyclical and is currently seeing a slight downside, Dhar expects it to be a temporary phenomenon with numbers expected to pick up significantly in the second half of this year. He added that the company is not just adding metric tonnes of capacity to what is already available, but also strategically introducing some of the specialty products used globally by the automotive industry, for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV). This will empower the Indian auto industry to not only strengthen its domestic market position but also evolve into an export hub. \r\n\r\nIndia's stature as the third largest automotive market in the world automatically puts it in comparison with China which currently exports about 4 million cars a year. This is equal to India's total car production which at present stands roughly around 4.2 million cars annually. \"So, definitely India can partake into that space of exporting vehicles out of India. And then if there are some automobile manufacturing hubs around the globe, India will also have steel available to supply steel to these hubs. But our first preference as a country should be that we produce more automobiles in India\" Dhar continued, before adding that the firm does not export automotive steel at present. Its overall steel exports account for around 5-6%.\r\n\r\nPLI scheme needs larger scale push\r\n\r\nResponding to the slow progress of investments in PLI scheme for specialty steel in India, the Ministry of Steel in February stated that as of December 2023, the selected companies under the PLI scheme have already invested about Rs 12,900 crore against an investment commitment of Rs 21,000 crore up to FY24. It is expected that another Rs 3,000 crore will be invested by these companies during  FY24, i.e., about Rs 16,000 crore of a total of Rs 29,500 crore will be invested by FY 2023-24. Additionally, the Ministry envisages an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in FY25.\r\n\r\n\"Typically, investments in the steel sector have a long gestation period and depend on, inter alia, procurement of various equipment, many of which are sourced from abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delays due to unavoidable circumstances in the projects include supply chain issues on the back of geopolitical factors, unforeseen events, natural disasters and changed market circumstances for certain PLI products also have an impact on the pace, phasing, and  the quantum of investmen,t\" the Steel Ministry said in a statement.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the advantages of the PLI Scheme for specialty steel, Dhar noted that it needs a bigger push towards manufacturing across all sectors. This strategy is crucial for job creation and sustained economic growth. He believes there to be a need for creating 15-20 mega-manufacturing zones across the country, encompassing automobiles, components, capital equipment, and other industries, spread across the country.",

      "News Body": "The production of direct reduced iron (DRI), also known as sponge iron, registered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8 per cent in India to 51.5 metric tonnes (MT) in fiscal 2024 from 34.7 MT in fiscal 2019, outpacing the 5 per cent growth in crude steel output, a report showed on Monday. India is the largest DRI producer in the world with its production set to rise above 75 MT by fiscal 2030 from 51.5 MT in fiscal 2024, according to a Crisil report. Small and mid-sized players accounted for 71 per cent of domestic DRI production in fiscal 2024, with large players accounting for the rest. \r\n\r\nDemand for DRI comes from long steel manufacturing. The share of long steel production rose from 51.5 per cent in fiscal 2019 to 54.8 per cent in fiscal 2024 driven by construction and infrastructure activities.\r\n\r\n\"That said, the trend is likely to reverse over the next three years as the share of flat steel production is expected to rise with large players enhancing their capacity through the blast furnace-blast oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route,\" the report said.\r\n\r\nIn absolute terms, though, production of long steel is likely to be higher than that of flat steel, it added.\r\n \r\nDomestic DRI production depends mainly on raw materials such as iron ore fines/pellets, coal and natural gas. India produces almost 80 per cent of sponge iron through the coal-based route and the rest through the gas-based route.\r\n\r\nThe country is self-sufficient in terms of iron ore and imports 30-40 per cent of its coal requirement from countries such as South Africa and Indonesia.\r\n\r\nIron ore production, at 277 MT in fiscal 2024, is expected to clock a CAGR of 7-9 per cent over the next five years. Moreover, pellet production islikely to rise on the back of increased capacity and demand from the crude steel sector, the report mentioned.\r\n\r\nThermal coal supply has increased since fiscal 2024 and is expected to rise further with additional supply from Coal India Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "News Body": "The sources said that the consortium will be partly supported by the steel ministry.\r\n\r\nIn industrial-scale hydrogen-based iron-making, also known as direct reduction of iron (DRI) using hydrogen, the oxygen is removed from the iron ore. But instead of using high carbon-emitting fossil fuels, it is done using hydrogen with the waste gas being water. The DRI so produced, also called sponge iron, is then fed into an electric arc furnace where electrodes generate a current to use it to produce steel.\r\n\r\nEarlier in June, India’s steel ministry had floated tenders under the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of $55 million, seeking participation from industry to pilot green steel making, that is steel made where carbon emissions or carbon content is substantially lower. The pilots will use hydrogen as an alternative to conventional coking coal, the sources said.\r\n\r\nSo far, a consortium-based pilot for a H2-based DRI facility has received a bid. IMMT, a government agency under the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), along with some other stakeholders have submitted bids now under consideration for funding, they said.\r\n\r\nThe last date for submission of bids was July 12 and only one bid has been received under the funding plan, the sources said.",

      "News Intro": "Indian sponge iron producers have urged the government to impose duties on exports of low-grade iron ore to stave off shortages of the main raw material in the world's second-biggest crude steel producer.",
      "News Body": "Indian sponge iron producers have urged the government to impose duties on exports of low-grade iron ore to stave off shortages of the main raw material in the world's second-biggest crude steel producer.\r\n\r\n\"We have urged the government that there is a shortage of iron ore, (so) please intervene and levy export duty,\" Rahul Mittal, chairman of the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association, told Reuters in an interview.\r\n\r\nIndia, the world's biggest sponge iron producer, has about 336 sponge iron plants spread across the country. India produces around 50 million metric tons of sponge iron, which is mostly used by secondary steel producers as raw material.India's iron ore exports touched 32.2 million metric tons during the first nine months of the current fiscal year that began in April 2023 - worth $2.7 billion - from 9.5 million metric tons a year earlier.\r\n\r\nMore than 90 per cent of India's overall iron ore shipments go to neighbouring China.\r\n\r\nThe surge in India's iron ore exports has rattled sponge iron producers who have complained about rising prices and falling supplies of the key ingredient in sponge iron making.Mittal said a sharp jump in iron ore exports has exacerbated shortages in recent months.\r\n\r\nBut sponge iron producers have been raising concerns about supplies since the government in November 2022 scrapped higher export tax on low-grade iron ore lumps, fines and pellets, reversing the May 2022 decision, he said.\r\n\r\nThe Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI), an industry body of mining companies, has asked the government not to impose curbs on iron ore exports. FIMI has argued that India ships out only low-grade iron ore, which is not widely consumed within the country.\r\n\r\nCountering FIMI's argument, Mittal said India's sponge iron producers use all grades of ore. \"There are so many producers using low grades.\"\r\n\r\nIndia is expected to produce 51 million metric tons of sponge iron in the fiscal year to April 2024.\r\n\r\nSponge iron output is expected to grow 15 per cent in 2024/25, Mittal said, highlighting the rising requirement of iron ore by India's sponge iron producers.Most of India's sponge iron output is consumed within the country.",

      "News Body": "The Task Force on Sustainable Just Transition, Government of Jharkhand and Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) jointly organised a stakeholder consultation ‘Decarbonising the Sponge-Iron Industries in Jharkhand’. The main objective of the consultation was to deliberate on the pathways to decarbonise the sponge-iron sector to contribute in the process of green steel production and net-zero scenario in the state. This consultation is a part of a series of meetings being conducted by the task force with different industrial sectors and associated stakeholders to receive their concerns and aspirations on the decarbonisation process for the larger aim of creating sectoral pathways under the ambit of sustainable energy transition in the state.\r\n\r\nElaborating about the intent of the consultation, Mr A.K. Rastogi (IFS Retd.), Chairman of Task Force on Sustainable Just Transition said that “Industry represents a significant portion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the state. The sponge-iron units are part of the iron-steel sector which is seen as a hard-to-abate in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and decarbonisation process. The iron-steel sector is an important contributor to the economic development of the state. Therefore, decarbonising the sponge-iron segment is crucial for the improvement of resource efficiency in the sector. In the wake of the net-zero scenario, the industry needs to shift from traditional carbon intensive technologies for iron & steel production to sustainability based and low-carbon environment friendly technologies. The decarbonisation strategies and pathways will contribute to the larger goal of sustainable energy transition in the state.’\r\n\r\nIndia is one of the largest producers of sponge-iron in the world producing around 22 million tonne sponge iron. Jharkhand is one of the leading states in terms of presence of stone-iron units, which are broadly represented under the small and medium enterprises. These units largely rely on fossil fuels for operationalisation of rotary kilns and other production related activities. The sector itself is heterogeneous and uses a wide range of equipment with often dated and inefficient technology.\r\n\r\nEmphasising the need of sector-specific interventions, Mr Ramapati Kumar, CEO of CEED said, ‘The sectoral analysis is important to understand the existing challenges, assessing the capabilities and creating pathways. The transition to green steel production requires a convergence approach from governments, industry, financial institutions and technology demonstrators for ensuring sustainable industrial development. A pathway can assist in the phase out of older polluting facilities and bring support for the deployment of new low-carbon emissions plants for production of green steel, which will lead towards sustainable energy transition in the state.’\r\n\r\nThe technical session discussed the key solutions through engagement of experts and industry representatives. The key ideas that presented were; establishing pilot and demonstration plants to test emerging low-carbon, increasing usage of energy efficient technologies, switching over to cleaner fuels like solar, recycling of steel scrap, infrastructure support for carbon, capture, utilisation & storage and green hydrogen ecosystem, capacity building measures and provision of finance to switchover to new fuels and technologies in the sector.\r\n\r\nThe consultation was attended by the leading sponge-iron units from private sectors, MSME associations, think-tanks and clean energy solutions providers from the state. The consultation witnessed participation of senior officials of leading companies and units such as Tata Steel, Tata Power, Rungta Mines, Aadhunik Steel, Nellanchal Ispat, Narsingh Ispat, Bihar Sponge & Iron, Sidhi-Vinayak Stone, Balaji Sponge Ltd, Shah Sponge & Power Ltd.

The proposals will come up for discussion during the 8th meeting of the board scheduled for Tuesday next week.",
      "News Body": "The Tamil Nadu State Board for Wildlife is likely to recommend construction and expansion of three red-category industries inside the default 10-km eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Pulicat bird sanctuary. The proposals will come up for discussion during the 8th meeting of the board scheduled for Tuesday next week.\r\n\r\nAs per the board's agenda notes, available with TNIE, there are 24 proposals listed for consideration and the most controversial items are three red categories industries (2 expansions projects and one new project) proposed in Gummidipoondi taluk of Tiruvallur district and their location falls within Pulicat ESZ. This has caused distress among environmentalists and bird lovers, who argue any further industrialization inside Pulicat ESZ would deteriorate an already fragile ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe three projects include the expansion of a steel melting plant and rolling mill for production of 76,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of goods and 83,000 TPA of MS Billets by M/s Kanishk Steel Industries, which is 9.09 km from the protected area.\r\n\r\nThe second project is also expansion of a steel melting plant to increase the production capacity from the current 1.42 lakh TPA to 2.88 TPA by M/s ARS Steel Industries Limited. This is located 7.87 km from the Pulicat lake.\r\n\r\nThere is a new project proposed for production of chemical compounds used in soaps, detergents and shampoos and the plant will come up at a distance of 8.12 km from the lake. These three projects have already been reviewed and recommended by the Office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden.\r\n\r\nNaturalist M Yuvan, who headed a team from Palluyir Trust to survey the wetlands and bird populations in the ESZ of Pulicat, told TNIE: \"Our studies post monsoons, show significant numbers of waterbirds including threatened and migratory species like Greater Flamingoes, Eurasian Curlews, Brownheaded gulls, etc using the wetlands throughout and even beyond the 10km ESZ of Pulicat bird sanctuary, given that the Ennore-Pulicat wetlands are hydrologically and ecologically contiguous. This contiguity is essential to take into account during wildlife and wetland conservation as the lagoon doesn't exist in isolation, but is fed and spreads into the Kosasthalayar river and the backwaters, saltpans, grasslands and scrub areas on all sides, where unfortunately industrialization is already heavy.\"\r\n\r\nHe said any further industrialization of Pulicat's ESZ needs to stop if this biodiversity hotspot and crucial wetland system is to retain its function, integrity and ecosystem services.\r\n\r\nG Sundarrajan, coordinator of environment advocacy group Poovulagin Nanbargal and member of Tamil Nadu Governing Council on Climate Change, told TNIE: \"There are enough studies conducted by NGT appointed committees, which recommended against setting-up of any more red category industries in Ennore-Pulicat wetlands. Any further shrinking of this area would mean trouble for the region, including Chennai city.\"\r\n\r\nWhen contacted, Chief Wildlife Warden Srinivas R Reddy told TNIE that these industries are located more than 7 km from Pulicate lake close to the SIPCOT industrial area in Gummidipoondi. \"The area is already industralised and as per the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), the zone of influence of the Pulicat lake doesn't go beyond 4 km. These projects will not come in the way of wildlife and bird conservation. The State Board for Wildlife can only recommend, the final decision will be taken by the National Board for Wildlife.\"",

      "News Intro": "The joint venture Alusort is digging deeper in the aluminium scrap pile. Commercial operations of Hydro’s advanced scrap sorting technology have started at PADNOS’s sorting hub in Grandville, Michigan",
      "News Body": "The joint venture Alusort is digging deeper in the aluminium scrap pile. Commercial operations of Hydro’s advanced scrap sorting technology have started at PADNOS’s sorting hub in Grandville, Michigan.\r\n\r\na large industrial machine\r\nOnly ten months ago, Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy company Hydro partnered with scrap management enterprise PADNOS to create Alusort LLC. Alusort is owned fifty-fifty by Hydro and PADNOS, and is located to supply Hydro’s Cassopolis and Henderson recycling plants with raw material for large-scale production of low-carbon Hydro CIRCAL, which is Hydro's line of recycled aluminium with minimum 75 percent post-consumer scrap content.\r\n\r\nThe proprietary HySort technology, pioneered in Europe and now used by Alusort, allows more mixed and challenging types of post-consumer aluminium scrap to be sorted into fractions, before being returned to the recycling plants as feedstocks. This enables the aluminium recycling plants to achieve streamlined production of high quality, low-carbon aluminium.\r\n\r\n“Aluminium is infinitely recyclable, but far too much of it ends up in landfills. The new sorting machine allows us to dig deeper in the pile and let more aluminium get a new lease on life. Advanced recycling is good for the environment, it’s good for the climate and it’s good for business,” says Duncan Pitchford, President of Hydro Aluminium Metals USA.  \r\n\r\nAccess to post-consumer scrap is becoming increasingly important for aluminium recycling companies like Hydro in the U.S. The establishment of Alusort and the USD 4 million investment in cutting edge sorting technology answers the call for putting valuable materials from cars, buildings, electronic equipment or other consumer goods to good use in a growing domestic market rather than sending it to landfills or exporting it overseas.\r\n\r\nPADNOS personnel are responsible for running daily operations at Alusort, with Hydro personnel overseeing activities and providing technical support. With its annual sorting capacity of 20,000 tonnes of aluminium scrap per year, the HySort machine is important for the production of high-quality, recycled alloys aimed at the U.S. automotive, building & construction, and other key markets.\r\n\r\n “We at PADNOS are continually investing in new technologies that increase the accuracy and throughput of recycled materials. We are thrilled to begin commercial operations of the Hysort machinery in conjunction with Hydro. The ramp-up of production will make a real difference for American manufacturing and, we hope, encourage everyone in the recycling industry to continue innovating toward a more circular, sustainable economy,” says Sam Padnos, Manager of Nonferrous Trading at PADNOS.\r\n\r\na group of people wearing safety vests\r\nThe teams from Hydro and PADNOS gathered in Grandville, Michigan, to mark the formation of joint venture Alusort LLC in November 2023.\r\nRecycling is the fastest way to zero emissions\r\nAluminium is recyclable without loss of the qualities that make it an important enabler for the green transition and recycling requires only five percent of the energy used to produce primary aluminium in a smelter. This is why it is vital to recycle more post-consumer scrap to accelerate emission cuts.\r\n\r\nStepping up growth in recycling capacity is one of the key factors in Hydro’s overall strategy towards 2030 to meet the increasing demand for low-carbon, recycled products. Hydro is continuously exploring new possibilities, both to source post-consumer scrap and develop advanced sorting technologies, to allow an increased amount of used aluminium to be sorted, repurposed and given a new life.\r\n\r\n“With the HySort technology now in operation we have reached yet another exciting milestone in our strategy to double the production and expand the portfolio of recycled products in the U.S. The sorted scrap from Alusort puts us in an even better position to bring more low-carbon aluminium to the U.S. market and help some of the most demanding customers in America reach their sustainability goals,” says Pitchford.\r\n\r\nFacts: Why aluminium recycling is important\r\nRecycling is the fastest way to deliver zero-carbon aluminium, requiring only five percent of the energy used to produce primary metal through electrolysis. Aluminium is also infinitely recyclable without loss of quality, making it an important enabler for the green transition.\r\n\r\nUnlike pre-consumer scrap originating from aluminium production and extrusion processes, post-consumer scrap has lived a past life as beverage cans, windows, car parts or other consumer products. It comes with a carbon footprint close to zero since the emissions have already been accounted for. This is why it is vital to recycle more post-consumer scrap to accelerate emission cuts.\r\n\r\nHydro’s proprietary HySort technology, utilizing laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), allows Hydro to dig deeper into the scrap pile to recycle aluminium that would otherwise end up in landfills. The technology was pioneered at Hydro’s recycling hub in Dormagen, Germany, and launches in the U.S. market in 2024 by joint venture Alusort LLC. in Grandville, Michigan.",

      "News Body": "Industry leaders like Novelis are fueling efforts to capture recycled aluminum's tremendous value for the global automotive supply chain via closed loop recycling programs and investments in new recycling operations. Now the focus turns to the industry's next challenge -- recapturing aluminum from vehicles once they are no longer on the road.\r\n\r\nNovelis has been working on this opportunity for years and we are making progress. We have invested in and deployed innovative scrap sortation and segregation operations that \"close the loop\" by enabling aluminum from end-of-life vehicles to be captured, further realizing the value of recycled content. We have also done research and developed new automotive aluminum alloys that accept higher scrap content along with creating single-alloy designs for hoods, doors and other closures that support design-for-disassembly initiatives.\r\n\r\nStill, to fully realize the opportunity presented to us as an industry, it is incumbent upon all players in the automotive supply chain to come together to make cost-effective recapture of high-value, end-of-life automotive aluminum a reality.\r\n\r\nThe Lay of the Land\r\n\r\nNovelis, our supply chain partners and forward-thinking automotive OEMs have made great strides in incorporating aluminum made from high amounts of recycled content into the latest vehicle models. The lightweighting and sustainability benefits delivered by aluminum-intensive designs are well-documented, and our close collaboration with some of the world's leading automotive manufacturers has created efficient, sustainable designs and circular economy standards and practices to enable high recycled content aluminum. Every pound of recycled aluminum used cuts GHG emissions by up to 95% versus using primary aluminum, delivering measurable performance and sustainability benefits to automotive OEMs and consumers alike.\r\n\r\nEVs Accelerate the Need for End-of-Life Recycling\r\n\r\nThe rise of electric vehicles – the vast majority of which leverage the lower weight, versatile performance properties and sustainability benefits of aluminum makes the search for solutions to end-of-life automotive aluminum scrap recapture an increasingly critical challenge for our industry's role in carbon reduction.\r\n\r\nEVs accounted for approximately 12.4% of all passenger cars sold worldwide in 2023, coming in at 10.8 million vehicles, with sales of EV passenger cars expected to reach 44 million units by 2035, according to GlobalData.\r\nThe latest survey by Ducker Carlisle predicts that aluminum use in new EV models will increase by nearly 100 net pounds per vehicle from 2020 to 2030.\r\nAs EVs reach their average operational end-of-life of 12.5 years in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, or are severely damaged in a crash, this aluminum needs to be recovered and recycled in ways that maintain the high value of the various alloys within it.\r\nA New Auto Dismantling Paradigm\r\n\r\nReclaiming automotive aluminum at a vehicle's end of life can result in significant value capture. When the vehicle is ready for recycling, before it is crushed, we can capture and segregate its various aluminum alloys before they are mixed into \"twitch\" – scrap that combines a wide range of aluminum types and alloys at the scrap yard, which leads to downcycling high-quality material rather than preserving it for re-use in its original form.  \r\n\r\nThis opportunity – and responsibility – for making optimal use of the aluminum recaptured from auto dismantling and end-of-life scrap recycling processes for EVs is shared across all players in the value chain.\r\n\r\nOEMs are working with Novelis and tier one suppliers on unialloy designs for hoods, door panels and other closures. Unialloy designs reduce the need to separate multiple alloys at the end of life, making recycling automotive aluminum more efficient and cost effective.\r\nNovelis is working to increase the recycled content of automotive aluminum sheet by developing new alloys that incorporate higher amounts of recycled material while maintaining the critical properties required by OEMs.\r\nSorting the aluminum within twitch using optical identification and AI-based sensor technologies offers the opportunity for further segregation of comingled aluminum scrap. Furthermore, these materials can be segregated into their respective alloy grades, minimizing downcycling.\r\nIt's important to keep in mind the primary objective here – ensuring we do everything we can to preserve the value of automotive aluminum so these alloys aren't downgraded unnecessarily due to inefficient vehicle design and poor end-of-life recycling practices. This benefits all participants:\r\n\r\nOEMs benefit from the increased availability of more recycled materials for use in building lighter weight, better performing vehicles.\r\nAutomotive dismantlers and scrap yards benefit from a more robust revenue stream resulting from early extraction of high-value automotive sheet alloys before they are co-mingled with less valuable aluminum types.\r\nNovelis and other automotive aluminum sheet providers benefit from more efficient recycling of high-value automotive sheet using segregated, alloy-specific, end-of-life automotive scrap.\r\nThis initiative to improve end-of-life aluminum scrap recapture won't happen all at once – some of these measures will take time to have a noticeable impact while others can benefit from our collective efforts in short order. The key is to recognize that we must come together as an industry to help drive these important initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe Way Forward is Clear\r\n\r\nThe development and adoption of higher recycled content automotive aluminum sheet is already under way, with progress coming in waves over the next few years. Increased collaboration across the supply chain – particularly at the end-of-life stage – is necessary to engage dismantlers and scrap yards in creating win-win business models from both a financial and sustainability perspective. Discovering new partnerships with technology providers also represents a promising opportunity to create a more efficient future state of aluminum recycling and ensure that no amount of aluminum is downcycled or ends up in the landfill. As an industry, we all must work together to achieve a new reality for automotive aluminum.

      "News Body": "Logan Aluminum Inc. plans to expand its operations in Logan County, according to documents from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer produces about 45% of the aluminum for the world’s beverage can industry. It also produces flat-rolled aluminum for the automotive industry and plays a “key role” in the commonwealth’s metals sector, said Brandon Mattingly, communications director for the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, in a statement to the Daily News.\r\n\r\nLogan Aluminum’s factory at 6920 Lewisburg Road in Logan County boasts more than 1,400 employees.\r\n\r\n“Logan Aluminum is a longstanding employer in Kentucky, having operated in Russellville since the 1980s, that provides a significant number of jobs for residents in Logan County and the surrounding region,” Mattingly said.\r\n\r\nThe expansion will involve adding production capacity for its beverage can and automotive businesses, according to KEDFA documents.\r\n\r\nBrittany Costellow, Logan Aluminum communications specialist, said the company was declining to comment until a later announcement.\r\n\r\nLogan Aluminum’s $249.8 million expansion was approved in May for $3 million in performance-based state tax incentives over the next 15 years through the Kentucky Business Investment program. KBI is designed to support new or existing companies in certain industries like manufacturing that locate or expand in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn order to receive the tax incentives, Logan Aluminum must create and maintain at least 65 full-time jobs at an average hourly wage of $37, including benefits, according to KEDFA documents.\r\n\r\nIn July, the company was approved for an additional $1 million in state tax incentives through the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act, which provides Kentucky sales and use tax refunds for building and construction materials used in property improvements.\r\n\r\n“The outlined planned investment and jobs will further solidify the company as a quality employer in the commonwealth and create opportunities for our residents,” Mattingly said.\r\n\r\nLogan Aluminum is not the only company planning manufacturing projects in Logan County. In late July, $200,000 in KEIA tax incentives for proposed construction of a new Schupan & Sons facility was also approved, according to KEDFA documents.\r\n\r\nThe $22.3 million project, which will create an aluminum processing facility, is Schupan & Sons’ first in Kentucky.

This is reported by NoticiasDe.\r\n\r\nDales Recycling Partnership is engaged in the processing of ferrous scrap. The deal is valued at $60 million and includes land, inventory and fixed assets related to the latter’s operations in Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe move is intended to increase Gerdau’s scrap processing through its own channels to provide the company with competitively priced raw materials for its operations.\r\n\r\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions for transactions of this nature.\r\n\r\nGerdau clarified that the acquisition is consistent with its strategy of growth and operational competitiveness through assets with great potential to create long-term value and expand into more profitable markets.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Gerdau and Danieli Corus, a subsidiary of the Italian steel equipment manufacturer, signed contracts to modernize blast furnace No. 01 at Ouro Branco, located in Minas Gerais. The project, among other things, includes the construction of a new furnace hearth.\r\n\r\nAs GMK Center previously reported, last year Gerdau signed an agreement to acquire Solar Arinos Holding to develop, build and operate a new solar energy park in Minas Gerais.",

      "News Body": "Steel Dynamics Inc. (SDI) has petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to apply antidumping duties against imports of corrosion-resistant flat-rolled steel (CORE) from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Additionally, the Fort Wayne, Indiana-based steelmaker is petitioning for countervailing duties against imports of CORE from Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nSDI says in a news release it has been joined by four other organizations in at least one or more of the cases, though it does not name those organizations.\r\n\r\nAccording to SDI President and Chief Operating Officer Barry Schneider, between the first half of 2023 and the first half of this year, CORE imports from the 10 countries mentioned in the antidumping petition “surged” 57 percent, from less than 1.25 million tons to almost 2 million tons.\r\n\r\n“The surge of unfairly traded imports of CORE has had a significant negative impact on the domestic steel industry’s volume, prices and profits, necessitating these cases,” Schneider adds.\r\n\r\nCORE steel is used in the production of automobiles, appliances and in many construction applications, for example, and CORE products consist of hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel that has been coated with zinc and, in some cases, aluminum, and may be painted or have other coatings applied to make the product corrosion-resistant. SDI says the present annual U.S. market demand for these products is more than 20 million tons.\r\n\r\n“Steel Dynamics has invested $3.7 billion in our steel divisions since June 2019, including investments in a new state-of-the-art 3-million-ton electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel mill; four flat-rolled galvanizing lines with Galvalume capability; and three flat-rolled paint lines,” says Christopher Graham, senior vice president of SDI’s Flat Roll Steel Group. “Corrosion-resistant flat-rolled steel is a strategically important product to the domestic steel industry, and the restoration of fair trade is critically important.”",

      "News Intro": "On August 29, Nippon Steel Co. announced that it would spend an extra $1.3 billion on investments in two US Steel Co. plants once its attempt to purchase US Steel for $14 billion goes through. The latest plans almost double a previous announcement earlier this year to spend $1.4 billion on other improvements through 2026, increasing the total to $2.7 billion.",
      "News Body": "On August 29, Nippon Steel Co. announced that it would spend an extra $1.3 billion on investments in two US Steel Co. plants once its attempt to purchase US Steel for $14 billion goes through. The latest plans almost double a previous announcement earlier this year to spend $1.4 billion on other improvements through 2026, increasing the total to $2.7 billion.\r\n\r\nBut despite the promises, Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel remains contentious, with the United Steelworkers and several prominent U.S. politicians opposed to the purchase of the one-time U.S. metals giant by a foreign company.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, Nippon Steel Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori said the latest investments would allow Nippon Steel to continue operating the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Gary, Indiana, plants.\r\n\r\n“We are excited to build upon the strong steelmaking legacy in the Mon Valley and Gary for the benefit of all stakeholders and the American steel industry for generations to come,” said Mori.\r\n\r\nThe latest promised investments would see $1 billion go towards increasing high-grade steel capacity at the Pittsburgh plant and the other $300 million towards extending the production life of one of the Gary plant’s blast furnaces. That’s in addition to $1.4 billion in “maintenance and other necessary capital investments” Nippon announced for US Steel properties in March.\r\n\r\nThe money is contingent, however, on the Japanese steel company actually acquiring US Steel. Despite reaching a deal with the U.S. company in late 2023, Nippon Steel’s $14 billion offer has fallen under political and regulatory scrutiny. The union representing US Steel’s workers and both major presidential candidates are against the deal.\r\n\r\nThe United Steelworkers favor the company’s purchase by Ohio-based rival Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. instead of Nippon Steel. In an August 28 statement, the union’s president, David McCall, noted that the promised funds from Nippon Steel are not binding.\r\n\r\n“A press release is not a contract,” he said, and called for Nippon Steel to “answer to pressing concerns regarding our critical supply chains and national security.”\r\n\r\nIn January, former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump opposed the deal in remarks made after meeting with the head of the Teamsters labor union. Trump, who favored aggressive tariff policies during his time in office, said he would “block it instantaneously.”\r\n\r\nAnd on Labor Day, his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, reiterated President Biden’s stance against the purchase. At a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, she said “US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.”\r\n\r\nFor its own part, Nippon Steel has cast its agreement to purchase U.S. Steel as a way of hindering the Japanese and U.S. steel industry’s largest rival, China.\r\n\r\nIn March, a day after President Joe Biden commented that US Steel should remain domestically owned, the Tokyo-based metals company said in a release that the planned acquisition would “strengthen American supply chains and economic defenses against China.”\r\n\r\n“No other U.S. steel company on its own can meet this challenge while also meeting antitrust requirements,” the company added, additionally promising the United Steel Workers there would be “no layoffs or plant closures until September 2026 under some conditions.”\r\n\r\nThe industrial dominance of China is a concern for Nippon Steel even in its home country. On August 30, Vice Chairman Mori said Japan should adopt similar trade policies to the United States and Europe to restrict Chinese steel imports.",

The transaction has received full support from David McCall, International President of the USW union.\r\n\r\nThe transaction implies a total enterprise value of approximately USD $2.5 billion (CAD $3.4 billion) for Stelco and represents an acquisition multiple of 4.8x 3/31/24 LTM Adjusted EBITDA with synergies. Cliffs has a clear line of sight to the achievement of approximately $120 million of estimated annual cost savings with no impact to union jobs. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to 2024 and 2025 EPS. The transaction implies pro forma net leverage of 2.4x 3/31/2024 LTM Adjusted EBITDA. Upon completion of the transaction, Cliffs shareholders will own approximately 95% and Stelco shareholders will own approximately 5% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis.\r\n\r\nStelco is an integrated steelmaker consisting of two operational sites, both located in the province of Ontario: Lake Erie Works, the newest and lowest-cost integrated steelmaking facility in North America; and Hamilton Works, a downstream finishing and cokemaking facility. Stelco ships approximately 2.6 million net tons of flat-rolled steel annually, primarily hot-rolled steel to service center customers. The acquisition of Stelco expands Cliffs’ steelmaking footprint and doubles Cliffs’ exposure to the flat-rolled spot market, with cost advantages in raw materials, energy, healthcare, and currency. Stelco adds capabilities that complement Cliffs’ existing operations and product portfolio, while diversifying its customer base across the construction and industrial sectors. The transaction brings substantial integration opportunities, generating synergies associated with procurement, overhead, and public company related expenses.\r\n\r\nVoting support agreements for the transaction have been entered into by Fairfax Financial Holdings, Alan Kestenbaum, an affiliate of Lindsay Goldberg and each of the other executive officers and directors of Stelco, which collectively represent approximately 45% of Stelco’s outstanding shares, pursuant to which such parties have agreed to vote all shares held by them in favor of the transaction, subject to customary exceptions.\r\n\r\nUpon closing of the transaction, Stelco is expected to continue operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary, preserving the name and legacy of the business.\r\n\r\nLourenco Goncalves, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Cliffs, stated: “I want to first recognize Alan Kestenbaum and the Stelco team for the remarkable turnaround they executed at Stelco, turning what was an underperforming asset under previous ownership into a very cost-efficient and profit-oriented company. In the process, they restored the Canadian national pride associated with Stelco, and we are going to continue that. We did this deal the way it should be done, reaching a respectful agreement between the two parties that keeps national interests at the forefront and recognizes the importance of the workforce. The enterprise value of this transaction is significantly lower than the cost of building an equivalent replacement mill in the United States, and the cost structure is lower than what a new U.S. mill would provide us. Stelco is a company that respects the Union, treats their employees well, and leans into their cost advantages. With that, they are a perfect fit for Cleveland-Cliffs and our culture. We look forward to proving that our ownership of Stelco will be a net benefit for Canada, the province of Ontario, and the cities of Nanticoke and Hamilton.”\r\n\r\nAlan Kestenbaum, Executive Chairman of the Board and CEO of Stelco, stated: “I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past seven years, and the value we have generated. This sale crystallizes a 32% CAGR on a Stelco common share investment since our IPO in 2017. Most importantly, we have revitalized Stelco and restored it to its iconic status in Canada. I know that Cliffs will continue to build upon the excellent work and life environment we have created for all of our employees, and continue to be a reliable supplier to our valued customers, while maintaining Stelco’s stature and reputation in Canada and maintaining our Canadian national interests. One of the important drivers for this transaction was receiving a meaningful portion of the consideration in Cliffs shares. I have strong belief and optimism in the North American steel market. I believe that Lourenco and his team have created a winning platform and I intend to remain an investor in Cliffs for a long time to come as he and his team continue to build out their platform and business.”\r\n\r\nDavid McCall, International President of the USW, stated: “On behalf of our entire membership, I am excited for this transaction and proud to support a deal that is great for the resilience of manufacturing and Union jobs in North America. Cleveland-Cliffs has a proven track record of making sure the Union always has a seat at the table, and this deal was no different. We are delighted to further expand our already great partnership between Cliffs and the USW.”\r\n\r\nBenefits to Canada\r\n\r\nCliffs is excited to expand its current 1,000-employee footprint in Canada, which consists of seven Tooling and Stamping plants and a Ferrous Processing and Trading Company (FPT) location, all in Ontario. The Company is committed to working with stakeholders and to deliver meaningful benefits to Canada, Ontario, and the communities where Stelco operates. Cliffs’ plan is to grow the business in Canada and build on the progress Stelco has made in recent years. In connection with this investment:\r\n\r\nStelco’s headquarters will remain in Hamilton and the name and legacy of Stelco will be preserved in Hamilton, Nanticoke, and Canada.\r\nStelco will continue its significant operations in Hamilton and Nanticoke, make capital investments of at least CAD $60 million over the next three years, and plans to increase steel production over current levels from those facilities.\r\nStelco will maintain significant employment levels in Canada and Canadian representation on the management team.\r\nRecognizing the importance of Stelco’s operations to the businesses in the region, Cliffs will ensure existing local supplier arrangements are maintained.\r\nCliffs values and will continue Stelco’s collaboration with McMaster University and CanmetMATERIALS and will maintain the existing research chairs with McMaster University.\r\nCliffs respects Stelco’s commitment to charitable and community support and will build on that legacy by increasing the overall charitable support by CAD $2 million per year, to be directed by Stelco’s management team.\r\nCliffs will continue Stelco’s partnership with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Forge FC and will maintain its 40% equity interest and the master lease of Tim Hortons Field. The community engagement program, including the Tiger-Cats High School Mentorship Program will also be maintained.\r\nCliffs is committed to operating the business and approaching sustainability in a way that supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and will ensure the Canadian operations operate in accordance with the Company’s sustainability priorities.\r\nAdditional Details\r\n\r\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by Cliffs’ and Stelco’s respective Boards. The Stelco Board formed a special committee of directors which, following review and consideration of the transaction, unanimously recommended the Stelco Board approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to approval by Stelco shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\r\n\r\nAdvisors and Counsel\r\n\r\nWells Fargo, J.P. Morgan and Moelis & Company LLC are acting as financial advisors to Cliffs. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP are serving as legal counsel to Cliffs.

      "News Intro": "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) announced today that two of its projects have been selected for award negotiations for up to $575 million in total funding from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to pursue two decarbonization investments at Middletown Works in Ohio and Butler Works in Pennsylvania. Following successful negotiations, these projects will allow for substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the Cliffs’ footprint and will also create efficiencies that meaningfully drive down operating costs while securing and growing good-paying Union jobs. This federal funding is being made available through DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "News Body": "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) announced today that two of its projects have been selected for award negotiations for up to $575 million in total funding from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to pursue two decarbonization investments at Middletown Works in Ohio and Butler Works in Pennsylvania. Following successful negotiations, these projects will allow for substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the Cliffs’ footprint and will also create efficiencies that meaningfully drive down operating costs while securing and growing good-paying Union jobs. This federal funding is being made available through DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\r\n\r\nMiddletown Works DRI Plant and Electric Melting Furnaces (up to $500 million grant)\r\n\r\nIf awarded, the Company would replace its existing blast furnace at its Middletown Works Facility in Middletown, Ohio with a 2.5mtpa Hydrogen-Ready Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) Plant and two 120 MW Electric Melting Furnaces (EMF) to feed molten iron to the existing infrastructure already on site, including the BOF, Caster, Hot Strip Mill, and various finishing facilities. Middletown will maintain its existing raw steel production capacity of approximately 3 million net tons per year and will no longer use coke for iron production. The EMF technology is well established and, together with the injection of hydrogen in blast furnaces, is a preferred route for meaningful reduction in carbon emissions for integrated steelmakers worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe process will dramatically reduce carbon emissions intensity, and will consolidate Middletown Works as the most advanced, lowest GHG emitting integrated iron and steel facility in the world. The facility will have the flexibility to be fueled by natural gas, which would reduce current ironmaking carbon intensity by over 50%; a mix of natural gas and clean Hydrogen; or clean Hydrogen, which would reduce current ironmaking carbon intensity by over 90%.\r\n\r\nHydrogen demand from this “flex-fuel” DRI plant stands to support DOE’s “Hydrogen Earthshot” and DOE’s Hydrogen hub initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe new facility is expected to reduce production costs by approximately $150 per net ton of liquid steel produced, or a $450 million annual savings relative to the existing configuration. These savings do not consider any of the premiums expected to be generated from sales of low-carbon steel, such as Cliffs H2™ and Cliffs HMAX™.\r\n\r\nThis investment will secure 2,500 jobs at Middletown Works, where the unionized workforce is represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). The flex-fuel DRI plant and EMFs will require 170 additional jobs. The project will result in 1,200 building trades jobs during peak construction.\r\n\r\nAs the DRI facility can be fed with standard, blast-furnace grade pellets, the project will take full advantage of the Company’s United Steelworkers (USW) represented iron ore mining and pelletizing units. The new configuration also avoids the use of significant amounts of prime scrap metal, which Cliffs anticipates will become shorter in supply and higher in cost throughout the rest of the decade. The process will also allow Cliffs to maintain the level of quality of the steel produced, which would otherwise be degraded with increased scrap usage, maintaining the Company’s leading position in the automotive end market.\r\n\r\nThe net capital outlay for Cliffs will be approximately $1.3 billion, net of capital avoidance on the existing blast furnace and coke plants, over a 5-year period primarily starting in 2025 and expected to conclude by 2029. Cliffs’ portion will be funded using liquidity on hand and its own free cash flow generation. The Middletown site offers enough available space to construct the new facility without encumbering the existing processes, effectively eliminating interference risks during the construction and commissioning phase. Cliffs thanks both Midrex and Hatch for their collaboration in developing the initial planning for this transformational project.\r\n\r\nThe Company does not anticipate any material capital spending related to this project to occur in 2024 and maintains its current capital expenditures outlook for this year, reiterating its capital allocation priorities currently focused on executing more aggressive share buybacks.\r\n\r\nButler Works Induction Reheat Furnaces (up to $75 million grant)\r\n\r\nIf awarded, Cliffs would also replace two of its existing natural-gas fired high-temperature slab reheat furnaces at Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania with four Electrified Induction Slab Reheat Furnaces, to bring optimum efficiency to its production of electrical steels, a critical component of the electrification of America and the greening of the electrical grid.\r\n\r\nThe primary benefits of this project are lower carbon emissions, substantially reduced energy costs and improvements in slab quality, allowing for approximately 25,000 tons of additional production capacity from improved process yield. This investment will secure 1,300 jobs at Butler Works, where employees are represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW). The project will require 220 building trades jobs at peak construction.\r\n\r\nThe company also expects to generate approximately $80 million in annual cost savings and yield improvements following the installation of the new equipment. The net cost of this facility to Cliffs is expected to be $100 million spent over a 4-year period.\r\n\r\nLourenco Goncalves, Cliffs’ Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer said: “Completion of our $1 billion clean hydrogen-ready Toledo DR Plant through the depths of COVID stood as strong evidence of Cliffs’ expertise and resolve to drive down emissions. We are grateful for the support of the Department of Energy and their recognition of Cleveland-Cliffs’ strong leadership in steel decarbonization. Through these selections, DOE recognized and rewarded Cleveland-Cliffs’ track record of successfully executing large capital projects that result in operational efficiencies and lower GHG emissions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Goncalves added: “The investment at Middletown Works is confirmation that Cleveland-Cliffs is the benchmark for iron and steelmaking technology in the world, ahead of Japan, Korea, Europe, and China. Our experience in using natural gas has seamlessly catalyzed our transition into using hydrogen. Middletown and Butler Works are both critically important to the success of Cleveland-Cliffs and the industrial might of the United States. Both plants support good-paying, middle-class union jobs. We appreciate the Biden Administration’s shared belief that union jobs are essential for continued success of manufacturing, supply chains, infrastructure, and defense in the United States. In addition, these projects have remarkably strong IRR’s and short payback periods. The Department of Energy has facilitated a perfect situation for our union workforce, our decarbonization endeavors, our communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and our shareholders.”\r\n\r\nU.S. Senator Sherrod Brown stated, “This partnership will ensure that IAM steelworkers in Middletown remain at the forefront of the global steel industry. This is why we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act – to ensure Ohio manufacturing continues to lead the world in the technologies that will drive our economy for decades to come.” Brown continued, “The Cleveland-Cliffs Middletown Works plant will support growing industries in Ohio while creating good-paying jobs, and ensuring that Ohio remains a national leader in manufacturing and innovation.”\r\n\r\n",

      "News Title": "Abandoned copper mines embraced as fast track to boost output",
      "News Intro": "In the race to secure copper for the clean energy transition and artificial intelligence applications, a range of companies are firing up abandoned assets once seen as financial liabilities to fast-track significant volumes of supply.",
      "News Body": "In the race to secure copper for the clean energy transition and artificial intelligence applications, a range of companies are firing up abandoned assets once seen as financial liabilities to fast-track significant volumes of supply.\r\nThe call for copper is poised to surge in coming years due to its role in electric vehicles, renewable energy and data centers for artificial intelligence. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 1.7% in 2035, and copper prices have scaled record highs this year.\r\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\r\n\r\nReport this ad\r\nSo companies are looking to revitalize older mines.\r\nTypically, it takes at least 10 years and as much as $5 billion to build a copper mine from scratch. Once companies raise capital there are other challenges. Local communities have opposed mining projects from Panama to Serbia.\r\nA Reuters analysis of at least four shuttered copper mines in the process of being restarted shows their owners trying to open a speedier pathway to supply around 7 million metric tons of metal in the next five years, adding to 30 million tons of output expected by 2031.\r\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\r\n\r\nReport this ad\r\nRehabilitating old mines \"taps into investor sentiment that it is going to be easier, and it is easier,\" said Daniel Bornstein, a partner at McCarthy Tetrault which has advised miners on rehabilitation.\r\nOne example: Selkirk First Nation in Canada’s Yukon Territory this year took over a mine in Yukon, Canada that was shuttered by Minto Metals last year. It had produced 226,000 tons of copper but shut after being declared bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe Minto mine is among the first mines in Canadian history to be bought by an Indigenous group. Details of reviving it with help from external operators are still being worked out in negotiations with creditors. The mine needs two years of work for production to start, court documents showed.\r\nIn Canada's Quebec province, Doré Copper Mining (DCMC.V), opens new tab, acquired by Australia's Cygnus Metals (CY5.AX), opens new tab, is reopening a site that has been dormant since 2008. In Spain, Denarius Metals (DMET.NLB), opens new tab is rehabilitating its Aguablanca mine after a seven-year hiatus.\r\nNevada Copper Corp (NEVDQ.PK), opens new tab, taken over by private equity firm Kinterra Capital in August, is ready to restart its Pumpkin Hollow underground mine after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year.\r\nNevada Copper operates both underground and open-pit mining. It changed hands several times as investors jumped in to unlock its open pit potential after feasibility studies pointed to higher ore grade material.\r\n\"We see long-term value in the open pit project. And once we do the institutional work and develop project financing for it, we think major mining companies will be interested in buying the project from us,\" said Kamal Toor, co-managing partner at Kinterra Capital.\r\nTotal volume at Nevada Copper is estimated at 3.5 million tons. The underground mine is essentially a restart, Kinterra co-managing partner Cheryl Brandon said, adding the open pit operation could be producing by the second half of this decade, ranking among the biggest in the U.S.\r\nDoré's Chibougamau mine in Quebec operated from the 1950s until it closed in 2008. In 2019, new owners took the company public as copper prices surged. It has the highest grade of copper in North America, said Ernest Mast, Doré's chief executive who had been leading the now-disputed Cobre Panama mine before it was taken over by First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO), opens new tab.\r\nWith a capital cost of C$180 million ($133.26 million), Chibougamau is one of the lowest-cost projects, Mast said. The company expects to start production by 2027.\r\nDenarius, a Toronto-based junior miner with assets in Spain and Colombia, cited surging global prices for the decision to revive its Aguablanca nickel-copper operation. Lundin Group shuttered it in 2016 when nickel prices collapsed.\r\n\"Mines don't disappear; our mine in Spain has operated since the Roman times,\" Denarius Chief Executive Serafino Iacono said. \"What changed was the price of the commodity.\"\r\nDenarius has an initial nickel and copper concentrate output target of 90 tons by the end of next year, Iacono added.\r\nDenarius has signed Trafigura and Boliden (BOLMIN.UL) as off-take partners, betting on a target price of $17,500 per tone for nickel and $10,000 per tone for copper. Mine rehabilitation costs are estimated at C$15 million.\r\nCHALLENGES\r\nDespite surging demand, efforts to renew the mines could be complicated by issues such as cyclical commodity prices, smelter charges and availability of skilled labor, said Rob McLeod, CEO of Nations Royalty, founded by the Nisga'a Nation in British Columbia.\r\nAlready, weaker demand from China has led some investors to raise bets on lower prices . Goldman Sachs slashed its target copper prices recently to $10,500 a ton from $15,000 previously.\r\nProducers face the challenge of timing production to match desired prices, Doré Copper's Mast said, citing difficulties around securing finance to finish construction.\r\n\"When you restart an old mine, the belief in the market is that you can bring this mine on quickly. The reality has been sometimes different,\" McCarthy Tetrault's Bornstein said.\r\nEven when old permits are in place, governments require miners to start from scratch, and obtain a full suite of permitting, he said. He also cited legacy environmental and social issues associated with abandoned mines built on Indigenous land.\r\nConcerns of Indigenous communities are usually \"not an unsurmountable obstacle, but an obstacle that you have to take into account as it could be more difficult to build a relationship,\" Bornstein said.",

      "News Title": "New Report Highlights Need for \"All-of-the-Above\" Strategy to Meet U.S. Copper Demand Amidst Clean Energy Transition",
      "News Intro": "A new report released today explores the unique opportunities the United States has in sourcing copper, a critical mineral for the energy transition. As global demand for copper—the “metal of electrification”—continues to rise, the U.S. must confront long development times for domestic mines, the need for expanded refining and recycling efforts, and its reliance on imports. The report, Copper in the US: Opportunities and Challenges, was commissioned by the Copper Development Association (CDA) and conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

      "News Body": "A new report released today explores the unique opportunities the United States has in sourcing copper, a critical mineral for the energy transition. As global demand for copper—the “metal of electrification”—continues to rise, the U.S. must confront long development times for domestic mines, the need for expanded refining and recycling efforts, and its reliance on imports. The report, Copper in the US: Opportunities and Challenges, was commissioned by the Copper Development Association (CDA) and conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The study found that without increased domestic production, the U.S. will be 60% reliant on foreign imports of refined copper by the year 2035.\r\n\r\n\"Copper demand is rising as society enters a new era of electrification and digitalization,\" said Adam Estelle, President and CEO of the Copper Development Association (CDA). \"With approximately 275 million metric tons of copper reserves and resources in U.S. soil, America is well positioned to be self-reliant in meeting copper demand for generations to come. However, we must be strategic to ensure our copper endowment can be accessed and supplemented. This requires an all-of-the-above approach that combines increased domestic mining and refining, increased recycling, and continued trade with reliable partners.\"\r\n\r\nKey Findings from the report:\r\n\r\nAbundant Reserves & Resources: The U.S. holds over 275 million metric tons of copper reserves and resources, enough to meet the nation’s projected demand for the foreseeable future; however, new U.S. mining projects currently average 29 years to begin production.\r\nTrade: Currently, imports account for 44% of U.S. refined copper demand. This reliance on imports is against a background of a substantial copper endowment. Development of these resources would reduce the reliance on imports.\r\nRecycling Potential: With copper being fully recyclable, over 2/3 of copper ever mined is still in active use today, and over 32% of the U.S. copper supply comes from recycled sources. While there are significant opportunities to increase U.S. recycling rates, copper products are durable and often last decades, limiting the amount of copper available for recycling today. As such, increased recycling on its own will not be sufficient.\r\nStrategic Trade Partnerships: Nearly all U.S. refined copper imports come from four countries with Free Trade Agreements: Chile, Canada, Peru, and Mexico. These partnerships are crucial, but these countries’ production is forecast to increase only 6% by 2035. In addition, nearly all seabound imports of copper come through the troubled Panama Canal bottleneck.\r\n \r\n\r\nCDA and its members are committed to bringing the value of copper to society responsibly and sustainably. The Association calls on policymakers to give copper credit by designating it as a Critical Mineral on the USGS list. This designation would attract significant investment in production, refining, and recycling, and help streamline the permitting process, empowering the U.S. to access its abundant copper endowment.\r\n\r\n\"It’s time to invest in a stronger, more resilient U.S. copper supply chain,” said Estelle. \"An all-of-government approach, which includes adding copper to the USGS Critical Minerals list, is required to address the opportunities ahead and to secure the metal of electrification for our nation’s future.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the Study\r\n\r\nCopper in the US: Opportunities and Challenges is available here. S&P Global Market Intelligence’s study offers an independent and objective assessment of the main ways in which the U.S. can meet its projected copper demand in the coming years. The study was supported by the Copper Development Association of the US (CDA). The scope of the study was agreed with the CDA, but the Association did not provide data or substantive input to the report. S&P Global Market Intelligence is solely responsible for the analysis and conclusions in the report.\r\n\r\nAbout Copper Development Association\r\n\r\nThe Copper Development Association is the not-for-profit trade association of the North American copper industry, chartered to bring the value of copper and its alloys to society through pre-competitive research, market development/promotion, and education, as well as technical and end-user support. CDA is proud to be a strategic partner of the International Copper Association (ICA), a powerhouse of expertise committed to promoting, protecting and defending copper around the world",

(“Hudbay” or the “Company”) (TSX, NYSE: HBM) is pleased to announce that it has received an Aquifer Protection Permit for the Copper World project (“Copper World”) from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (“ADEQ”). The company proactively engaged with the ADEQ, ensuring a transparent and thorough permitting process by providing comprehensive and detailed information.

      "News Body": "Hudbay Minerals Inc. (“Hudbay” or the “Company”) (TSX, NYSE: HBM) is pleased to announce that it has received an Aquifer Protection Permit for the Copper World project (“Copper World”) from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (“ADEQ”). The company proactively engaged with the ADEQ, ensuring a transparent and thorough permitting process by providing comprehensive and detailed information. The issuance of this permit is a key milestone in the advancement of Copper World, which is a standalone operation requiring state and local permits and is expected to produce 85,000 tonnes of copper per year over a 20-year mine life.\r\n\r\n“Receiving the Aquifer Protection Permit is a significant de-risking event for Copper World as it brings us one step closer to being fully permitted,” said Peter Kukielski, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The last key state-level permit, the Air Quality Permit, continues to progress as planned and will mark the completion of one of the three key prerequisites in the company’s prudent sanctioning plan for the project. Copper World represents Hudbay’s next significant copper growth project and is expected to increase consolidated annual copper production by more than 50% from current levels. Copper World will also be a key contributor to the domestic U.S. supply chain with our plans to produce Made-in-America copper.”\r\n\r\nOnce in production, Copper World is expected to be a meaningful copper producer in the U.S. domestic copper supply chain, which will be required to help secure growing U.S. metal demand related to increased manufacturing capacity, infrastructure development, increased energy independence and domestic battery supply chain and production needs. The “Made-in-America” copper cathode anticipated to be produced at Copper World is expected to be sold entirely to domestic U.S. customers and would make Copper World the third largest cathode producer in the U.S.i\r\n\r\nCopper World Permitting on Track\r\n\r\nThere are three key state permits required for Copper World sanctioning:\r\n\r\nMined Land Reclamation Plan – Completed – the Mined Land Reclamation Plan was initially approved by the Arizona State Mine Inspector in October 2021 and was subsequently amended and approved to reflect a larger private land project footprint. This approval was challenged in state court, but the challenge was dismissed in May 2023.\r\nAquifer Protection Permit – Completed – the Aquifer Protection Permit was received on August 29, 2024 from the ADEQ following a robust process that included detailed analysis by the agency and Hudbay, along with a public comment period that was completed in the second quarter of 2024.\r\nAir Quality Permit – On Track – the Air Quality Permit application was submitted to the ADEQ in late 2022 and follows a similar robust process, including a public comment period that commenced in July and is scheduled to conclude in September 2024.\r\nHudbay is pleased with the level of local support received at the public comment meetings and looks forward to providing significant social and environmental benefits for the community and local economy in Arizona. Over the proposed initial 20-year mine life, the company expects to contribute more than $850 million in U.S. taxes, including approximately $170 million in taxes to the state of Arizona. Hudbay also expects Copper World to create more than 400 direct jobs and up to 3,000 indirect jobs in Arizona. Copper World will offer competitive wages and benefits, and the company intends to engage in partnerships with local apprenticeship readiness programs and community-based workforce training programs across the skilled and technical levels to fill and maintain all positions. The company has received support from several local unions, with the signing of a letter of intent for the project execution phase in May 2024, including The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Forgers and Helpers Local 627, The Laborers International Union of North America Local 1184, and The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local 1912.\r\n\r\nAdvancing Prudent Financing Plan with Disciplined Capital Allocation\r\n\r\nAs part of Hudbay’s disciplined financial planning approach to Copper World, in October 2022, the company introduced a three prerequisites plan (“3-P”), as shown in Figure 1, including specific leverage targets and other criteria that would need to be achieved prior to making a project sanctioning decision for Copper World. The 3-P plan has the following components:\r\n\r\nPermits – receipt of all required state level permits\r\nPlan – completion of a definitive feasibility study with an internal rate of return of greater than 15%\r\nPrudent Financing Strategy – multi-faceted financing strategy, including a committed minority joint venture partner, a renegotiated precious metals stream agreement optimized for the current project, net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.2 times, a minimum cash balance of $600 million, and limited non-recourse project level debt.\r\nSince the release of the 3-P plan, Hudbay has taken prudent measures to transform its balance sheet in preparation for a sanctioning decision, through strong cash flow generation, deleveraging initiatives and the completion of a successful equity offering. Hudbay has generated $824 million in Adjusted EBITDAii and substantially reduced net debtii by $559 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024. The net debt reduction, together with higher levels of adjusted EBITDAii, have improved the company’s net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratioii to 0.8x. This improved balance sheet flexibility and accelerated debt reduction significantly advances the company’s progress towards its 3-P plan for sanctioning Copper World and has resulted in the successful achievement of the targeted 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio well ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\nWith the receipt of the Aquifer Protection Permit, the company expects to commence activities related to the preparation of feasibility studies for Copper World. As a result, 2024 growth capital spending in Arizona is expected to increase by an additional $25 million, compared to the company’s original 2024 guidance of $20 million.\r\n\r\nHudbay intends to commence a minority joint venture partner process after receiving the last outstanding permit. The company expects the potential joint venture partner to participate in the funding of definitive feasibility study activities in 2025 as well as in the final project design and construction for Copper World.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to sanction Copper World is not expected until early 2026 based on current estimated timelines. The decision to sanction Copper World will ultimately be evaluated against other competing investment opportunities as part of Hudbay’s capital allocation process.\r\n\r\nBolstering the Arizona Team\r\n\r\nWith the significant progress achieved to-date and the continued advancement of Copper World towards a project sanctioning decision, Hudbay has been actively expanding its local team in Arizona to build project bench strength and establish key leadership roles.\r\n\r\nHudbay’s Senior Vice President of the U.S. Business Unit, Javier Del Rio, has been focusing his time solely on leading the Copper World project, leveraging his project development and operational expertise as the former head of Hudbay’s South America Business Unit where he oversaw the development and operation of the company’s flagship Constancia mine in Peru. In addition, Warren Flannery, Hudbay’s Vice President of Business Planning and Reclamation, will relocate to Arizona to take on the role of Vice President of Copper World. In his new role, Mr. Flannery will lead the operational readiness of Copper World as the company commences early feasibility work and plans to complete a definitive feasibility study in 2025.\r\n\r\nAdding to the team’s U.S. expertise, Hudbay has hired Robert Comer as Executive Director, External Affairs & Legal in Arizona. Mr. Comer brings more than 30 years of U.S. permitting and mining law experience. During his career, Mr. Comer has held senior leadership positions with businesses and the federal government and has successfully advanced numerous resource projects, including through environmental and land use compliance, defending permits through litigation, NEPA permitting and government relations. He will be a significant asset to Copper World as Hudbay continues to advance towards a sanctioning decision.\r\n\r\nAbout Copper World\r\n\r\nThe 100% owned Copper World project is located in Pima County, Arizona, approximately 50 kilometres southeast of Tucson. The Copper World project includes seven deposits discovered in 2021, together with the East deposit (formerly known as the Rosemont deposit). A new resource model was completed for the preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) of Copper World in 2022, which contemplated a two-phased mine plan with Phase I as a standalone operation requiring state and local permits only and Phase II expanding onto federal lands requiring federal permits.\r\n\r\nIn September 2023, Hudbay released its enhanced pre-feasibility study (“PFS”) for Copper World reflecting the results of further technical work on Phase I of the project. Phase I has a mine life of 20 years, which is four years longer than the Phase I mine life that was presented in the PEA, largely due to an increase in the capacity for tailings and waste deposition as a result of optimizing the site layout. Phase II is expected to involve an expansion onto federal lands with a significantly longer mine life and enhanced project economics. Phase II would be subject to the federal permitting process and was not included in the PFS results.\r\n\r\nBased on the PFS, Phase I contemplates average annual copper production of 85,000 tonnes over a 20-year mine life, at average cash costs and sustaining cash costs of $1.47 and $1.81 per pound of copperiii, respectively. A variable cut-off grade strategy allows for higher mill head grades in the first ten years, which increases annual production to approximately 92,000 tonnes of copper at average cash costs and sustaining cash costs of $1.53 and $1.95 per pound of copperiii, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total initial funding requirement for Phase I of Copper World, net of the stream agreement, amounts to approximately $1.1 billion. At a copper price of $3.75 per pound, the after-tax net present value (“NPV”) of Phase I using an 8% discount rate is $1.1 billion and the internal rate of return (“IRR”) is 19%. The valuation metrics are leveraged to higher copper prices and at a price of $4.25 per pound, the after-tax NPV (8%) of Phase I increases to $1.7 billion, and the IRR increases to 25.5%.\r\n\r\nCopper World is one of the highest-grade open pit copper projects in the Americasiv with proven and probable mineral reserves of 385 million tonnes at 0.54% copper. There remains approximately 60% of the total copper contained in measured and indicated mineral resources (exclusive of mineral reserves), providing significant potential for Phase II expansion and mine life extension. In addition, the inferred mineral resource estimates are at a comparable copper grade and also provide significant upside potential.\r\n\r\nQualified Person and NI 43-101\r\n\r\nThe technical and scientific information in this news release related to the company’s Copper World project has been approved by Olivier Tavchandjian, P.

      "News Intro": "The Copper Development Association (CDA) is thrilled to announce the publication of ASTM B1029: Standard Practice for Making Press-Connect Joints with Seamless Copper and Copper Alloy Tube and Press Fittings. This new standard provides a crucial framework for the installation of copper press fittings, ensuring consistent, high-quality practices across plumbing, mechanical, and HVAC/R applications.",
      "News Body": "The Copper Development Association (CDA) is thrilled to announce the publication of ASTM B1029: Standard Practice for Making Press-Connect Joints with Seamless Copper and Copper Alloy Tube and Press Fittings. This new standard provides a crucial framework for the installation of copper press fittings, ensuring consistent, high-quality practices across plumbing, mechanical, and HVAC/R applications.\r\n\r\nAs a leading authority in copper piping, CDA has long been instrumental in shaping industry standards. CDA helped develop ASTM B828 for solder fittings over 20 years ago, setting the benchmark for that technology. In response to the growing use of press fittings and the increasing number of manufacturers in the market, CDA has once again partnered with ASTM. The result is ASTM B1029, a comprehensive standard that upholds the highest levels of performance and reliability for the installation of copper press fittings.\r\n\r\n\"Press-connect technology is a great alternative for our industry, providing engineers and installers with a reliable, predictable, and efficient flameless joining methods,” said Marcus Elmer, Vice President at CDA. “The Copper Development Association is dedicated to driving innovations that enhance the performance and safety of copper piping systems. The standardization of press-connect technology is a major leap forward, enabling consistent, high-quality installations that meet the demanding requirements of today’s construction and industrial sectors.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAddressing Industry Needs\r\n\r\nThe introduction of ASTM B1029 comes in response to several pressing issues within the industry:\r\n\r\nDiverse Installation Practices: Different press fitting manufacturers, both domestic and international, have varied installation practices and training materials.\r\nBest Practices for Installers: There has been a need for clear, consensus-based guidelines for installers to follow when working with press fittings.\r\nTo tackle these challenges, ASTM B1029 has been developed as a consensus standard, offering a unified set of best practices for consultants, engineers, and contractors. This new standard will serve as a minimum requirement for manufacturers' installation and training protocols and will provide building owners with a reliable reference to train their service teams.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResources for Installers and Building Owners\r\n\r\nTo assist installers in understanding and applying the new standard, CDA is preparing a new instructional video, set to be released before the end of the year. In the meantime, the existing video, “How-to: Install Copper Press-Connect Systems,” remains a valuable resource. Additionally, the Copper Tube Handbook offers comprehensive guidance on copper piping systems.\r\n\r\nImplementation and Training\r\n\r\nASTM B1029 is effective immediately and available for purchase through ASTM International. Installers can reach out to CDA for training, compliance information, and to share best practices related to the new standard. Engineers and building owners can now incorporate “ASTM B1029” into their specifications for press fittings, ensuring that installations adhere to the latest guidelines.",

      "News Title": "Freeport Project Selected to Receive $80 Million from U.S. Department of Energy",
      "News Intro": "Freeport-McMoRan has been selected to receive $80 million through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy for a project to use geothermal energy to heat leaching stockpiles in Morenci and Safford and integrate battery energy storage and microgrid operations to improve electrical reliability in Morenci.",
      "News Body": "Freeport-McMoRan has been selected to receive $80 million through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy for a project to use geothermal energy to heat leaching stockpiles in Morenci and Safford and integrate battery energy storage and microgrid operations to improve electrical reliability in Morenci.\r\n\r\nBy using geothermal energy, the project aims to generate clean, industrial-scale heat to enable the recovery over time of billions of pounds of residual copper through the company’s Leach to the Last Drop initiative from already mined material previously considered unrecoverable. The project could increase copper recovery by 25 million pounds or more annually, depending on the geothermal resources.\r\n\r\nThe microgrid and battery elements represent about half of the cost and only will be at the Morenci mine. They will add reliability to the electrical distribution system in Morenci, Clifton and potentially the regional grid, and provide battery storage for back-up during power outages.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the project, including the geothermal and power grid elements is approximately $175 million, including the DOE contribution. The work is scheduled to take about five to seven years to complete.\r\n\r\nKathleen Quirk, President of Freeport-McMoRan, said the partnership with DOE will advance the company’s innovative work to boost copper production from existing stockpiles.\r\n\r\n“Now, we are bringing to this project a clean energy element to facilitate extraction of copper that was previously thought to be unrecoverable,” said Quirk in a conference call with reporters and other grant recipients. “So, we are finding new sources of copper that can be cleaner than what we’ve produced in the past in a way that’s beneficial to the entire community and beneficial to what we’re trying to do as a company – to bring more copper into the U.S. market to help facilitate the clean energy future.”\r\n\r\nThe geothermal project will enhance Freeport’s Leach to the Last Drop efforts by providing a clean source of energy to add heat to the stockpiles. Leaching at higher temperatures is a demonstrated way of improving copper recovery.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with the microgrid technology and battery energy storage, the project will decrease the mines’ reliance on onsite backup generators, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and improve the resilience of the local communities in Morenci and Clifton.\r\n\r\n“This DOE partnership allows us to continue to build on this success, utilizing clean geothermal heat to drive further increased recovery of copper in alignment with our commitment to responsible production,” said Cory Stevens, President, Freeport-McMoRan Mining Services.\r\n\r\nTwenty percent of the award scoring was based on the company’s Community Benefits Plan, which includes creating 121 construction and 12 full-time jobs at the operations. In addition, the company will continue strengthening its partnerships with high schools, technical and community colleges and universities to help students access skills to help them participate in this project and other economic benefit opportunities. The company also will continue to provide 300 annual scholarships for Native Americans to help ensure access to clean energy and other quality jobs that may be indirectly spurred by this project. The company also plans to increase investments in multiple new climate resilience projects.\r\n\r\nThe cooperative agreement is one of five projects selected to receive up to $475 million in total DOE funding to accelerate clean energy deployment on current and former mine land. Others selected are in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Nevada. The money is part of the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed in 2021.\r\n\r\n“These projects will advance energy and environmental justice and help ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition flow directly to impacted communities,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. She added they will help meet the Biden administration’s ambitious clean energy and climate goals and accelerate clean energy solutions that are critical to reducing pollution and creating healthier communities.",

Technology is set to play an increasingly important role in discovering the resources the world will need in the decades to come. This alliance offers a great opportunity to work with Ivanhoe Electric and the innovative technologies they have built.”\r\n\r\nKey Terms of the Exploration Alliance\r\n\r\nBHP (through a wholly owned subsidiary) will provide $15 million to fund the Alliance for its initial three-year term, which term may be extended by mutual agreement.\r\nAny funding beyond the initial $15 million provided by BHP would be on a 50/50 basis.\r\nIvanhoe Electric will provide access to one of its new generation Typhoon™ geophysical surveying systems and CGI inversions for use by the Alliance.\r\nThe Alliance will operate in two stages – a Project Generation Phase and a Joint Venture Phase.\r\nIvanhoe Electric will be the operator of the Alliance during the Project Generation Phase. Operatorship of any project in the Joint Venture Phase will be mutually agreed upon in the future.\r\nThe parties have agreed to six initial AOIs which cover an area of approximately 3,655 km2. Both parties have agreed that their activities within the AOIs during the Project Generation Phase will be conducted exclusively for the benefit of the Alliance.\r\nThe Alliance will be governed by an Alliance Management Committee, composed of an equal number of members from Ivanhoe Electric and BHP.\r\nAny Joint Venture that is agreed to be established will have 50/50 ownership.\r\nExploration Alliance in the United States\r\n\r\nDuring the Project Generation Phase, the Alliance will conduct early-stage generative exploration activities in the six initial AOIs. The goal of these initial activities is to identify and stake mineral rights within the AOIs to form a project and/or acquire such mineral rights from third parties. Except for one AOI where an affiliate of Ivanhoe Electric currently holds staked mineral rights that will be transferred to the Alliance, no mineral rights are presently held in the initial AOIs.\r\n\r\nEarly-stage activities currently contemplated by the Alliance’s initial work plan for 2024 include airborne geophysical surveys, supporting geological fieldwork, as well as ground-based geophysical surveys, including with Ivanhoe Electric’s proprietary Typhoon™ system.\r\n\r\nOnce mineral rights are acquired a “project” will be formed which the Alliance will continue to fund and explore. There may be multiple projects identified within a single AOI.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance will operate through an Alliance Management Committee in the Project Generation Phase, as well as through a Technical Committee. The Alliance Management Committee will be composed of an equal number of members from Ivanhoe Electric and BHP. Ivanhoe Electric will, however, have a deciding vote in this phase where the matter does not require unanimous approval. Unanimous matters include certain health, safety, and environmental matters, approval of the annual work plan and budget, and proposals to form new AOIs or acquire rights within an AOI.\r\n\r\nThe Joint Venture Phase will commence when a project within an AOI is approved by the Alliance Management Committee to become a “Joint Venture Project”. With that approval, a Joint Venture will be formed between Ivanhoe Electric and BHP over that specific Joint Venture Project within an AOI. Until a joint venture is formed, Ivanhoe Electric through affiliates will be the legal owner of the various project rights. If formed, each Joint Venture will be conducted through a special purpose limited liability company.\r\n\r\nIf a proposal to form a Joint Venture is not approved by the Alliance Management Committee and more than $3 million has been spent in the relevant AOI, then the nominating party may independently pursue the project, and the mineral rights will be transferred to the nominating party for no consideration, ending the Alliance concerning that project. However, if more than $5 million has been spent in the relevant AOI, then the other party will retain a 1% net smelter royalty over the project should it not wish to proceed to form a joint venture.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Joint Venture Phase is to further explore and evaluate the exploration results to assess its technical and economic merit, and if agreed upon, to develop and operate a mine and associated infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance will deploy Typhoon™ on a wide scale across the United States in the search for deep, undercover mineral deposits\r\n\r\nTyphoon™ is the brand name for Ivanhoe Electric’s proprietary electrical geophysical surveying transmitter. Typhoon™ achieves its results through its unique specifications, which include a current output of up to 200 amps and a voltage output of up to 10,000 volts. The transmitter uses switches and capacitance systems, which generate a very pure and stable transmitted signal, resulting in an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio.\r\n\r\nTyphoon™ was developed specifically to identify deep geophysical anomalies in environments that have highly resistive surface conditions and to detect the presence of sulfide minerals containing copper, nickel, gold and silver in areas where potential deposits are hidden by cover and where target depths exceed the range of conventional geophysical surveying systems. Ivanhoe Electric has deployed Typhoon™ at its Santa Cruz, Tintic, Hog Heaven and White Hill projects in Arizona, Utah, Montana and Nevada respectively, as well as its 50/50-owned joint venture with Saudi Arabian Mining Company Ma’aden in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe new generation of Typhoon™ that the Alliance will deploy has more modern switches, diodes, capacitors and transformers in the unit, as well as improved cooling systems, which will increase reliability and running time in hotter environments, such as the Southwest United States and Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nIvanhoe Electric believes the next generation of major mineral discoveries in the United States will likely be made deep beneath the surface, in areas where younger, unmineralized cover overlays the older underlying prospective geology. Typhoon™ is well-suited to identify sulfide mineral deposits at great depths using its proprietary design. TyphoonTM has the ability to deliver a stronger, cleaner electrical current than competing systems, allowing it to achieve industry-leading effective depth penetration to over 1.5 km. CGI’s advanced, machine learning-based inversion software utilizes complex algorithms to quickly and efficiently convert the data provided by TyphoonTM into detailed images of chargeability anomalies.\r\n\r\nOther Terms of the Alliance\r\n\r\nOther terms of the Exploration Alliance Agreement during the Project Generation Phase include:\r\n\r\nEither party may terminate the Alliance once the initial $15 million BHP funding commitment has been spent or the three-year initial term has ended. In these circumstances, neither party may pursue any activities in the AOIs for one year. If a party breaches this requirement, the non-breaching party may call for the re-establishment of the Alliance in respect of any interest acquired.\r\nIf the agreement terminates once the initial funding commitment from BHP is spent, BHP retains a 12-month back-in right over projects that are not joint ventures. BHP can back into a project by paying Ivanhoe Electric 50% of its expenditures following the date of termination. In limited circumstances the back-in right may extend for two years. For more detailed information related to the terms of the Exploration Alliance Agreement, please see the Form 8-K filed with the SEC.\r\nAbout Ivanhoe Electric\r\n\r\nWe are a U.S. company that combines advanced mineral exploration technologies with electric metals exploration projects predominantly located in the United States.

      "News Body": "Munich / Mountain View (USA). Through its venture capital fund BMW i Ventures, the BMW Group has taken a stake in US (Colorado) based company, Jetti Resources. The goal is to foster responsible and resource-conserving copper extraction to address rising demand in a more sustainable way. Founded in 2014, Jetti Resources has developed a pioneering process for copper extraction that utilizes previously unused ore from existing copper mines.\r\n\r\n'By investing in Jetti, we are supporting technological progress in the field of copper extraction, with a focus on responsible and resource-conserving methods,' says Wolfgang Obermaier, Head of Indirect Goods and Services, Raw Materials, Production Partners of the BMW Group. 'This new process has the potential to improve the environmental footprint and integrity of our supply chain, even with growing demand for resources like copper' Obermaier adds.\r\n\r\nAs copper is a vital raw material to produce electric drivetrains in EVs, demand is forecasted to grow substantially in the coming years. As early as 2030, at least half of BMW Group's global sales will consist of fully electric vehicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsing existing resources\r\n\r\nJetti Resources has developed a unique catalytic leaching technology that enables the extraction of copper from previously unexploited ores. Around 70 percent of the world's copper resources are bound up in those primary sulfide ores. Material, previously stored in dumps and considered waste, can now be tapped into with this new form of resource-conserving extraction.\r\n\r\nThis process enables the recovery of previously trapped copper resources, thus significantly increasing the output and lifespan of existing copper production facilities. This way, copper extraction becomes substantially more efficient and reduces its environmental impact. Jetti Resources’ method allows copper mines to use heap leaching on these ores, which causes around 40% fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional raw material extraction and uses only approximately 50% of the water. The technology is already being deployed to great success at industrial scale. Jetti Resources plans to push ahead with global expansion together with its partners.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResponsible supply chain management\r\n\r\nThe BMW Group has made sustainability and resource efficiency central to the company's strategic direction. A key aspect is compliance with strict environmental and social standards in every part of their supply chains. Eliminating infringements on human rights and environmental standards is a key priority in procuring essential raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Group analyses and prioritizes raw materials on an ongoing basis as part of its materials strategy. Potential risks arise primarily from extracting and processing raw materials and material groups. The BMW Group mitigates these risks with a mix of standardized, proactive, and reactive measures uniquely tailored to each raw material. To ensure the necessary transparency and traceability of raw material processing within the BMW Group's complex and dynamic supplier network, they are participating in Catena-X, an alliance for secure and standardized data exchange in supply chains.",

      "News Title": "Sustainability Awards 2024 Finalist Interview: Husky’s recyclable PET bottle closure",
      "News Intro": "As part of our Finalist Interview series ahead of the Sustainability Awards, we spoke to Husky Technologies about its PET closure for still water, said to be fully compatible with existing PET recycling streams and nominated in the Pre-Commercialized Driving the Circular Economy category.",
      "News Body": "Husky’s PET closure is an example of a truly disruptive innovation that further improves plastic packaging’s position as the most, circular and sustainable option. Husky’s entry is an innovative disruption in enabling mono-material beverage packages, lightweighting opportunities and tamper evidence.\r\n\r\nUntil now, the plastic beverage packaging industry has relied primarily on a two-material solution for beverage packaging – bottle (PET) and closure (HDPE or PP).\r\n\r\nGenerally, PET recycling streams are known and well established. PET is the most widely and commonly recycled plastic in the world, according to the UN Environment Programme’s ‘Baseline report on plastic waste’ in 2020. Its material properties can endure countless recycling and re-processing iterations without losing its mechanical and chemical properties. Its strength and lightweighting capabilities make it ideal for bottle applications.\r\n\r\nWhile both HDPE and PP can be recycled, their widespread use beyond food contact applications require that these be downcycled into other non-food contact products like outdoor furniture, pails, and children’s toys. There is insufficient availability at the scale required to support the beverage packaging industry.\r\n\r\nA two-material approach requires additional efforts in sortation and reduces rPET bale yield. Pursuing a mono-material approach where the closure is manufactured from the same material as the bottle addresses previously identified deficiencies. Husky’s PET closure product is a pathway towards improving the sustainability and circularity of the entire beverage package, as recycling efforts are simplified and the required infrastructure is in place.\r\nThe rigid material properties of PET enable further lightweighting at the dispensing system level (neck and closure). For example, the closure thread is significantly more rigid in relation to HDPE. This improves strip torque performance and requires less thread engagement.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the thread engagement, you can reduce the height of both the neck and closure. This reduced height translates into meaningful weight savings when comparing a mono-material versus dual-material package.\r\n\r\nThe tamper evident band design lends itself to an improved level of application that imposes little to no stress on the bridges during the capping process. This improves reject rate performance, creating less waste during the production process.\r\n\r\nThe opening experience is unmatched by any beverage closure solution currently on the market. The bridge break is distinctly audible and virtually simultaneous for all the bridges, and the tactile response during bridge break is unmistakable. The visual cue of the dropped TE band is obvious.\r\n\r\nFinally, can you tell us about the ongoing development of your project, e.g. how your innovation/initiative has been received by industry, or what are the next steps in commercialization/product development?\r\n\r\nHusky’s PET closure solution was unveiled at the 2024 National Plastics Exposition (NPE) in Orlando Florida in May. Industry feedback has been overwhelmingly positive as brands and converters recognize the sustainability, security, and aesthetic benefits that a PET closure offers.\r\n\r\nHusky is currently in the early adopter phase with multiple installations coming online in 2025 with select brands. We continue to enhance our learnings by evaluating new PET materials (vPET and rPET alike) to determine operating windows and establish performance values.\r\n\r\nWe are pursuing a phased rollout focusing first on the still water beverage segment. We will expand our scope to include more performance demanding applications (carbonated soft drink (CSD) and sensitive (JSDT)) once we have incorporated any early adopter learnings.\r\nThe aggregation tanks will be located in the Port of Rotterdam to optimize supply chains and streamline logistics. As Neste is securing liquefied waste plastic supply through various suppliers across Europe, this central and major logistics hub offers seamless connectivity to the continent's expansive infrastructure. The state-of-the-art tank solution and surrounding infrastructure will ensure safe and reliable storage of liquefied waste plastic. The preparation and installation of the tanks have been meticulously planned demonstrating both companies' commitment to safety and excellence. The tanks are expected to be operational in the second half of 2025, matching the schedule for the ongoing construction of capacity upgrading facilities for liquefied waste plastic in Porvoo.\r\n\r\n“The new aggregation tanks in Rotterdam enabling efficient logistics are crucial in optimizing our supply chain and in reaching our ambitious goals of processing liquefied waste plastic. We are continuously expanding our network of suppliers for liquefied waste plastic and the new storage significantly enhances our offtake flexibility. This paves the way for a more sustainable and circular plastics economy and we are excited about the opportunities this collaboration brings,” says Andreas Teir, Head of Chemical Recycling at Neste. \r\n\r\n“This new collaboration marks a significant advancement in our long-term commitment to sustainability and the energy transition. In the second half of 2025, we will begin stocking liquefied waste plastic, diversifying our product portfolio and reinforcing our leadership in the storage of more sustainable, low-carbon products. Building on our existing collaboration with Neste, this partnership supports our strategy to broaden our service offering and to support Neste in paving the way for a more sustainable and circular economy,” says Bruno Hayem, CEO of Tepsa.\r\n\r\nNeste is advancing chemical recycling of plastic waste and has the ambition to process over one million tons of plastic waste per year. To process larger amounts of liquefied waste feeds, we are building upgrading capacities for 150,000 tons of liquefied waste plastic per year. We are using raw materials like liquefied waste plastic or liquefied discarded rubber tires and refine them into high-quality drop-in feedstock for the production of new plastics.",

      "News Title": "New EU rules to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging",
      "News Intro": "On Wednesday, Parliament adopted new measures to make packaging more sustainable and reduce packaging waste in the EU.",
      "News Body": "On Wednesday, Parliament adopted new measures to make packaging more sustainable and reduce packaging waste in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe regulation, which aims to tackle constantly growing waste, harmonise internal market rules and boost the circular economy, was approved with 476 votes in favour, 129 against and 24 abstentions.\r\n\r\nReduce packaging and restrict certain types\r\n\r\nThe rules, which have been provisionally agreed on with the Council, include packaging reduction targets (5% by 2030, 10% by 2035 and 15% by 2040) and require EU countries to reduce, in particular, the amount of plastic packaging waste. To reduce unnecessary packaging, a maximum empty space ratio of 50% is set for grouped, transport and e-commerce packaging; manufacturers and importers will also have to ensure that the weight and volume of packaging are minimised.\r\n\r\nCertain single use plastic packaging types will be banned from 1 January 2030. These include packaging for unprocessed fresh fruit and vegetables, packaging for foods and beverages filled and consumed in cafés and restaurants, individual portions (for e.g. condiments, sauces, creamer, sugar), accommodation miniature packaging for toiletry products and very lightweight plastic carrier bags (below 15 microns).\r\n\r\nTo prevent adverse health effects, the text includes a ban on the use of so called “forever chemicals” (per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances or PFASs) above certain thresholds in food contact packaging.\r\n\r\nEncourage reuse and refill options for consumers\r\n\r\nSpecific 2030 reuse targets are foreseen for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages packaging (except e.g. milk, wine, aromatised wine, spirits), transport and sales packaging, as well as grouped packaging. Member states may grant a five-year derogation from these requirements under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nFinal distributors of beverages and take-away food will have to offer consumers the option of bringing their own container. They will also be required to endeavour to offer 10% of products in a reusable packaging format by 2030.\r\n\r\nRecyclable packaging, better waste collection and recycling\r\n\r\nUnder the new rules, all packaging (except for lightweight wood, cork, textile, rubber, ceramic, porcelain and wax) will have to be recyclable by fulfilling strict criteria.\r\n\r\nMeasures also include minimum recycled content targets for plastic packaging and minimum recycling targets by weight of packaging waste.\r\n\r\nBy 2029, 90% of single use plastic and metal beverage containers (up to three litres) will have to be collected separately (via deposit-return systems or other solutions that ensure the collection target is met).\r\n\r\nQuote\r\n\r\nRapporteur Frédérique Ries (Renew, BE) said: “For the first time in an environmental law, the EU is setting targets to reduce packaging, regardless of the material used. The new rules foster innovation and include exemptions for micro-enterprises. The ban on forever chemicals in food packaging is a great victory for the health of European consumers. We now call on all industrial sectors, EU countries and consumers to play their part in the fight against excess packaging.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nCouncil needs to formally approve the agreement as well before it can enter into force.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nIn 2018, packaging generated a turnover of EUR 355 billion in the EU. It is an ever-increasing source of waste, the EU total having increased from 66 million tonnes in 2009 to 84 million tonnes in 2021. Each European generated 188.7 kg of packaging waste in 2021, a figure that is expected to increase to 209 kg in 2030 without additional measures.\r\n\r\nIn adopting this legislation, Parliament is responding to citizens’ expectations to build a circular economy, avoid waste, phase out non-sustainable packaging and tackle the use of single use plastic packaging, as expressed in proposals 5(1), 5(3), 5(4), 5(5), 11(1), 11(4) and 20(3) of the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe.",

      "News Body": "The Coca‑Cola Company is rolling out redesigned, lighter-weight PET bottles across its sparkling beverage portfolio across the U.S. and Canada as part of a broader commitment to create a circular economy for its packaging.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a decade, 12-, 16.9- and 20-oz. bottles of Trademark Coca‑Cola, Sprite and Fanta—as well as Minute Maid Refreshments and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas—are sporting new shapes that require less raw material to produce. \r\n\r\n“We’ve been continuously working to ‘right-weight’ our bottles, incrementally going from 27 to 21 grams over the last 10 years,” said Alejandro Santamaria, Sr. Director for Global Packaging Development and Innovation. “But we’d reached the ‘floor’ with our previous designs. Our breakthrough innovations in modeling technology, which reduce the weight of our bottles to 18.5 grams, represent a major step in reducing the amount of materials used while preserving the durability and functionality of our packaging and, most importantly, the quality and taste standards of our beverages.”",

      "News Intro": "Aldi and Packamama have produced ‘flat’ wine bottles made entirely from recycled PET, said to be almost seven times lighter than glass alternatives and streamline both transportation and storage.",
      "News Body": "Aldi and Packamama have produced ‘flat’ wine bottles made entirely from recycled PET, said to be almost seven times lighter than glass alternatives and streamline both transportation and storage.\r\n\r\nReleased yesterday in line with Global Recycling Day, the own-brand bottles are thought to be the first of their kind in the UK. They are said to weigh 63g and remove 42 tonnes of bottle weight for their first launch.\r\n\r\nFor retailers, the compact design is set to allow 30% more bottles to be loaded onto pallets for transportation. Compared to traditional round bottles, the flat alternatives aim to take 30% of lorries off the road and lead to environmental benefits without reducing the amount of wine in a pack.\r\n\r\nConsumers, meanwhile, are expected to benefit from the lighter weight when carrying the products around the store and back to their homes. Their flat shape is set to enable easier stacking and organization in storage.\r\nAdditionally, since the bottles are made of recycled PET, they are designed to be stronger than glass and ‘completely shatterproof’.\r\n\r\nJulie Ashfield, managing director of Buying at Aldi UK, says: “We know shoppers are looking for greener, more sustainable products and our aim is to continue to deliver this, whilst offering great value and enhanced functionality. We’re pleased to be taking the next step in expanding our recyclable, eco-friendly range.”\r\n\r\nThe bottles were developed alongside London-based packaging company Packamama; the company aspires to combat global warming with new designs for the drinks industry.\r\n\r\n“We are honoured to partner with Aldi, a true pioneer in the grocery sector, as we both lead the way in sustainable wine packaging,” adds Santiago Navarro, CEO & founder of Packamama. “This collaboration delivers the much-loved Chapter & Verse in our innovative eco-flat bottles to customers, offering the perfect blend of quality, value, and sustainability.”\r\n\r\nThe new bottles will apply to Aldi’s Chapter & Verse Shiraz and Chapter & Verse Chardonnay products and are available across the UK, as well as through Click & Collect.\r\n\r\nAldi also launched a recyclable PET bottle for its Chassaux et Fils Méditerranée Rosé yesterday. It claims to be eight times lighter than the average 75cl glass bottle and to help remove 18.15 tonnes of bottle weight from this launch alone.\r\n\r\nThe retailer aims to lower the average bottle weight of all its still wine products by 8% and expects to complete the process by 2025.\r\n\r\nAll the way back in 2020, Garçon Wines and Accolade Wines’ Banrock Station brand came together to develop a flat bottle made from 100% recycled PET. Reportedly, the 75cl bottles required 75% less energy to produce and emitted 79% less CO2 than virgin PET.\r\n\r\nAccolade Wines went on to work with Packamama and Taylors Wines to launch a similar bottle – made from 100% recycled and recyclable PET with a flatter profile that reportedly allows twice as many bottles to fit in a standard wine case – in 2022.\r\n\r\nIn other beverage news, Berry has provided NEUE Water with a flat rPET bottle for its luxury artesian mineral water. Its ergonomic shape is designed to fit into pockets, bags, and seatback storage on public transport and maintain enough strength for refill and reuse.",

      "News Intro": "In light of Hungary’s new deposit return scheme, Petainer and Oonly have released their first refillable PET bottle for mineral water on the Hungarian market in hopes of driving circularity in the country’s beverage sector.",
      "News Body": "In light of Hungary’s new deposit return scheme, Petainer and Oonly have released their first refillable PET bottle for mineral water on the Hungarian market in hopes of driving circularity in the country’s beverage sector.\r\n\r\nWhen compared to a refillable 1.5L glass bottle, the Oonly bottle weighs 106g and uses around 4.24g of material per cycle compared to a glass bottle’s approximately 800g. Its light weight is thought to enable ‘vigorous’ washing between cycles.\r\n\r\nApparently, the bottle can achieve the equivalent workload of around 25 bottles in its lifespan of roughly 25 cycles. Since reusable bottles can end up scuffed as they travel through cycles, the Oonly bottle’s textured design is set to highlight its branding and protect the quality and purity of the mineral water inside, which is drawn from a protected water table in the foothill of St Martin’s Hill in Pannonhalma.\r\n\r\nOonly also uses state-of-the-art, industry 4.0 robotized equipment to fill the bottles at its greenfield site. The machinery has a potential annual fill capacity of over 50 million bottles, the companies claim.\r\n\r\nReleased ahead of Europe’s 2030 target for reuse, the bottle is hoped to introduce a circular solution for beverage packaging to the Hungarian market.\r\n\r\n“Petainer are delighted to be the partners for Oonly’s revolutionary project for the Hungarian market,” says sustainability director Michael Joyes PhD. “The team at Oonly had a clear vision for their product, knowing that the packaging itself would be as important as the pure spring mineral water they bottle from their source.\r\n\r\n“There is not just a demand for quality mineral water on the Hungarian market, but also for sensible packaging formats. The Hungarian market suffers from low collection and recycling rates of the 2 billion bottles placed on the market each year, which reuse can address.\r\n\r\n“Refillable PET has been proven in markets where it is present to reduce environmental spillage and collection, with 97-99% collection in the German market at current count. Hungary is taking steps already with the implementation of a Deposit Return Scheme from 2024, which will support the collection of bottles including Oonly’s.\r\n\r\n“Going further with the implementation of reuse, Oonly can offer customers the most sustainable packaging format for beverages.”\r\n\r\n“In Hungary 100% of household mineral water consumption is brought to market in single use PET bottles,” added István Polony from Oonly. “Our research indicates that the market is ready for environmentally conscious innovation as a solid 18-20% of consumers declare to make consumption choices based on health and sustainability factors.\r\n\r\n“As pioneers of the refPET category in Hungary we wanted to make sure to align our efforts with the industry leader Petainer. We are confident, that the value proposition of Oonly, with premium quality mineral water packaged in sustainable refPET containers from Petainer will attract an ever-growing segment of the environmentally focused consumer base and will pave the way for the emergence of a significant refPET category in Hungary.”\r\n\r\nIn a similar development, Bottle Up recently unveiled what is described as the first pre-filled, plant-based, fully reusable water bottle sold in the UK; it seeks to become a renewable and recyclable alternative to single-use plastic bottles.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, reusable cups are now accepted in café, drive-thru, and mobile orders at all company-operated and participating licensed Starbucks stores in Canada and the United States. The company hopes that the development will contribute towards its goal of halving its waste by 2030.",

      "News Body": "With upcoming European regulations requiring beverage producers to embrace packaging circularity and returnable bottles, Sidel has developed a dedicated PET bottle for carbonated beverages designed for long-standing reuse.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the European Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, the focus is on creating a circular economy where returnable bottles are at the forefront. With a target of 25 percent of bottles to be reusable by 2040, there is now increasing demand for returnable packaging and refillable production lines over a food grade bottle-to-bottle process.\r\n\r\nFor packaging manufacturers looking to introduce returnable bottles, PET is the material of choice. Using PET helps to reach lighter bottle weights and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nTo meet the needs of the returnable carbonated beverages bottle market, Sidel experts have designed a PET bottle with a best-in-class weight and a high level of resistance which can withstand numerous washing cycles.\r\n\r\nRobust bottle endurance\r\nThe returnable packaging design has been developed for sustained endurance and consumers can return the same bottle into a deposit scheme to be reused multiple times. This bottle is qualified to withstand up to 25 refillable loops.\r\n\r\nCombined with a dedicated blowing process, the preform and structural design enable the bottle to endure high washing temperatures. The bottle also includes a reinforced neck to guarantee top bottle quality in neck-held washing and refill cycles.\r\n\r\nLightweight and fully recyclable\r\nWith the packaging industry aiming to reduce its material usage, this structural design is available in various bottle formats, such as 1L, 1.5L and 2L and provides significant opportunity for lightweighting. For example, the 1.5L bottle weighs just 77g and offers ultra-high performance with 28 percent weight saving compared to the market average.\r\n\r\nEven when this new returnable bottle reaches the end of its useful life, it can be recycled into a new bottle, continuing the circularity of PET.\r\n\r\nProven expertise in PET packaging, blowing and complete lines\r\n\r\nWith more than forty years of leadership in blow-moulding equipment for PET bottles, Sidel offers dedicated solutions to support beverage producers’ switch to returnable bottles.\r\n\r\nFor example, Its EvoBLOW eHR range is a standout solution from Sidel and enables the highest preform reheating capability and blowing bottles in hot moulds. This results in increased bottle performance and an output of up to 1,300 bottles per hour per mould for CSD and carbonated water (for a 1L bottle).\r\n\r\nFind out more about returnable bottles and how you can access this kind of support for your business on the Sidel website.\r\n\r\n“We are proud to be part of this pioneering project with 4peoplewhocare.” says Veronika Brucks, Senior Marketing Manager Gerresheimer Moulded Glass Europe. “The combination of glass containers and 100% bio-based closures made from forewood material are a perfect match with the sustainability ideas behind this new cosmetic product.”\r\n\r\nProduct launch at Vivaness trade show\r\nFrom 13 to 16 February the world of natural cosmetics met at the Vivaness trade show in Nuremberg, Germany.

      "News Intro": "Neste, a Finland-based supplier of renewable fuels and feedstock for plastics, is partnering with Suntory, ENEOS and Mitsubishi Corporation to enable the production of PET bottles with renewable materials replacing fossil alternatives (via a mass balance approach) on a commercial scale.",
      "News Body": "Neste, a Finland-based supplier of renewable fuels and feedstock for plastics, is partnering with Suntory, ENEOS and Mitsubishi Corporation to enable the production of PET bottles with renewable materials replacing fossil alternatives (via a mass balance approach) on a commercial scale.\r\nPET (polyethylene terephthalate) is a type of clear, strong, lightweight plastic. It is the preferred material for plastic bottles. But like most plastics, new PET is predominantly synthesised from fossil hydrocarbons - although PET bottles in many regions come with high collection and recycling rates.\r\n\r\nDevelopments in hydrocarbon production technology mean it is now possible to produce PET from bio-based materials.\r\n\r\nThis is what Finland-headquartered Neste, a supplier of renewable fuels and feedstock for plastics, will be doing for the first time with its renewable feedstock Neste RE in collaboration with Japanese oil and energy company ENEOS, Mitsubishi Corporation, and beverage major Suntory.\r\n\r\nENEOS will use bio-intermediates based on Neste RE to produce bio-PX (Bio-Paraxylene) at its Mizushima Refinery in Okayama, Japan. The bio-PX will then be converted to PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) and subsequently to PET resin for Suntory to use to manufacture their PET bottles. Mitsubishi Corporation will be coordinating the collaboration between the value chain partners.  \r\n\r\nA mass balancing approach will be applied to allocate the bio-based feedstock to the PET bottles, which will be used by Suntory for its products in 2024.\r\n\r\nHow is a renewable feedstock for PET made?                ​\r\nNeste is using bio-based materials such as waste and residue oils and fats and turning them into renewable fuels and raw material for polymers.\r\n\r\nRaw materials for Neste include used cooking oil, vegetable oil processing waste and residues, for example palm fatty acid distillate, spent bleaching earth oil or palm effluent sludge. Others include tall oil based raw materials, technical corn and animal and fat fish wastes from food processing.\r\n\r\nIn the mid- to longer-term, Neste expects to introduce novel vegetable oils derived from advanced, more sustainable agricultural concepts to its raw material portfolio.\r\n\r\n“Our Neste technology allows us to turn renewable raw materials into pure hydrocarbons that can then be used in the existing plastic value chains and infrastructure,” ​explained Lilyana Budyanto, head of sustainable partnerships APAC at Neste Renewable Polymers and Chemicals business unit. \r\n\r\nThis is the role of Neste’s renewable Neste RE. Being ‘drop in’ feedstock means that it can be used to replace fossil feedstock in the production of all kinds of plastics without the need to change the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhile Neste RE can and has been used in value chains for polypropylene, polyethylene or other polymers, the cooperation with Suntory marks the first time renewable Nestle RE is being used for the production of PET. “We believe this project to be among the first instances of fully renewable PET in general,” ​Budyanto told this publication.\r\n\r\nDecarbonising production with renewable feedstock for PET bottles​\r\nOther non-PET applications are also running across the US, Germany and Japan, amongst other geographies. In the US, McDonald’s has been using renewable polymers for clear cups, and in Japanese supermarkets it’s possible to buy onigiri or noodles wrapped in polymers made from renewable Neste RE. In Germany, Tchibo is also using them to make coffee capsules.\r\n\r\nA major benefit for food and beverage companies is that polymers based on Neste’s feedstock are ‘completely the same’ as those from conventional materials when it comes to properties, quality or safety, according to the company.\r\n\r\nYet, they come with a much lower footprint. As in the case with the Suntory collaboration, the renewable feedstock replaces fossil feedstock in the production of PET bottles. “This will lead to a decrease in the dependence of fossil resources and an improved carbon footprint for the PET bottles,” ​Budyanto told this publication.\r\n\r\nNeste’s own life cycle assessment (LCA) for Neste RE – the feedstock only, not including further value chain steps up to the final PET application – suggests it reduces the carbon footprint by more than 85% when replacing fossil feedstock.",

The move aims to increase polymer supply to meet growing demand and proportionately reduce dependence on imports.",
      "News Body": "Kolkata-headquartered Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) has unveiled plans to set up an oil-to-chemicals (O2C) project in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, to increase polymer production, including ethylene and propylene. The move aims to increase polymer supply to meet growing demand and proportionately reduce dependence on imports.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the launch of the ambitious project, Navanit Narayan, Chief Executive Officer of HPL, stated, “This project aims to directly convert crude oil into vital chemicals like ethylene and propylene. We are seeking investors for the Cuddalore project, which is a venture at the global scale and is in talks with the central government for incentives. Our dialogues with financial partners are in the advanced stage. We are hopeful that we will be able to finalize the proposal very soon.”\r\n\r\nEthylene and propylene are key ingredients for manufacturing end-products ranging from shopping bags and car parts to water and sanitation pipes. Upon completion of this project, the cutting-edge HPL facility is expected to boast an impressive capacity to manufacture 3.5 million tonnes of these essential polymers annually. Once this project commences commercial production, India will be able to reduce polymer imports proportionately.\r\n\r\nExpressing confidence in the ongoing negotiations with lenders, Narayan said, “The cutting-edge facility is designed to maximize value extraction, with 80 percent of the crude oil feedstock slated for direct conversion into high-value chemical products. The remaining part of the proposed project will be processed into conventional fuel products like diesel. We will be able to attract investment from major global and domestic players for the Cuddalore project.\r\n\r\nFinal decision by year-end\r\nAmid ongoing talks with potential lenders, the final investment decision (FID) is expected by year-end, with pending funding arrangements, the project’s construction and commissioning are anticipated to take at least four to five years. Once the final investment decision is concluded, HPL will order the necessary plant and machinery and begin construction on the project.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, HPL’s parent company the United States-based The Chatterjee Group is concurrently investing Rs 4,000 crore (approximately US$500 million) in a downstream chemical venture in Haldia, West Bengal, in addition to the proposed Cuddalore mega project. According to Narayan, state-of–the-art facility in Cuddalore may be completed by early 2026 and will produce approximately 300,000 tonnes of phenol and 185,000 tonnes of acetone annually, recognizing itself as the largest such complex in India.\r\n\r\nRobust demand\r\nHPL's investment proposal comes at such an important time, fuelled by the robust domestic demand for chemicals and the global petrochemicals industry's oversupply woes, exacerbated by China's record capacity additions last year. The apex industry body, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers’ Association (CPMA), in its annual report published for 2022, projected India’s overall polymer demand at 17.05 million tonnes for the financial year 2022-23, a rise of 7.2 percent from 15.9 million tonnes reported in the previous fiscal year. India’s polymer demand had increased by 7.7 percent in the financial year 2021-22 from 14.78 million tonnes in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nCPMA estimates India’s cumulative polymer production at 13.69 million tonnes, at 90 percent of factories’ operational capacity in the financial year 2022-23, as against 12.86 million tonnes of actual output reported with the same operating rate in the previous financial year. Presently, India has a total production capacity of 15.14 million tonnes, a marginal increase from 14.23 million tonnes in the previous year.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, nearly a fifth of India’s polymer demand is met through imports. In the financial year 2022-23, CPMA estimates India’s polymer import at 3.93 million tonnes. Considering a total export of around 636,000 tonnes, India’s polymer trade deficit is estimated at 3.3 million tonnes, according to CPMA. While polymer exports declined substantially over the years, imports have increased.\r\n\r\nCapacity expansion\r\nA recently published report reveals that Indian producers have been consistently devising strategies to expand their production capacity, aiming to cater to the escalating domestic demand and foster self-sufficiency in polypropylene. Consequently, the Indian industry could potentially witness an additional capacity of approximately 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) within the next three years, facilitated by Nayara Energy’s 0.5 million tonnes project, may come on stream shortly.\r\n\r\nThree projects, one from each Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL), and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), are anticipated to become operational in 2024. HPCL is slated to commence commercial production with its 1 million TPA project, while both CPCL and IOCL are projected to initiate their 475,000 TPA and 450,000 TPA of PP production, respectively, in 2024. Furthermore, IOCL and Gail India Ltd are preparing to launch commercial production for their 200,000 TPA and 500,000 TPA PP projects in 2025.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these capacity expansions might prove insufficient to meet India’s mounting demand across existing and emerging applications. The projection indicates that India’s PP demand will continue its growth trajectory, thereby offering a promising prospect for global exporters. The consultancy firm TransGraph has estimated that the transportation, rubber, and plastic sectors will be pivotal in driving India’s PP demand to reach 7.84 million tonnes by the financial year 2026-27.",

With petrochemical producers undertaking limited expansion, India’s installed ethylene capacity is poised to stagnate thereafter.",
      "News Body": "India’s ethylene capacity is expected to increase by 10.5 percent in the financial year (FY) 2023-24, owing to a substantial capacity expansion undertaken by HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL). With petrochemical producers undertaking limited expansion, India’s installed ethylene capacity is poised to stagnate thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe apex industry body, the Chemicals & Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association of India (CPMA), in its latest assessment report titled ‘Indian Petrochemical Industry,’ estimates India’s total ethylene capacity at 86.77 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in FY2023-24 (ending March 2024), a rise from 78.53 MTPA reported in the previous year. However, the ethylene capacity in India is projected to stabilize at 86.77 MTPA thereafter due to the lack of fresh investments in either brownfield or greenfield projects.\r\n\r\nWith demand rising sustainably, capacity utilization would continue to increase, albeit at a slow pace. According to the CPMA report, ethylene capacity utilization in India is set to end FY2023-24 at 88 percent, a decline from over 93 percent in the previous year. At this rate, the country’s cumulative ethylene production is estimated at 75.95 million tonnes in FY2023-24, compared to 73.12 MTPA in the previous year. Total ethylene production in India may rise to 77.61 million tonnes in FY24-25. With an estimated 31,000 tonnes of imports against exports of 70,000 tonnes, India would ramp up dispatches to overseas clients from 35,000 tonnes in the previous year. Simultaneously, total ethylene imports into the country are estimated at 56,000 tonnes in FY2022-23.\r\n\r\nCPMA further estimates India’s propylene capacity to rise to 76.02 MTPA in FY2023-24, a substantial increase from 70.71 MTPA and 66.14 MTPA during FY2022-23 and FY2021-22, respectively. The premier industry body projects the country’s propylene production at 57.35 million tonnes in FY2023-24, compared to 59.08 million tonnes in the previous year. India’s propylene imports and exports are likely to remain ‘nil’ in FY2023-24, as against a modest 15,000 tonnes of imports and ‘zero’ exports in the previous year.\r\n\r\nHMEL expansion\r\nFormed in 2007 as a public-private partnership (PPP) joint venture between the government-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Singapore-based Mittal Energy Investment Pte Ltd (MEIL), a company owned by the Indian billionaire Lakshmi N Mittal, HMEL’s production assets represent the single largest investment in any sector in Punjab, India. HMEL has established its name with its superior petroleum and petrochemical products and is a value-driven organization, benchmarking itself against the global best to deliver consistent excellence to fuel India’s growth story.\r\n\r\nKnown as HMEL’s Guru Gobind Singh Refinery at Bhathinda, Punjab, this project is strategically positioned to respond to India’s ever-changing energy needs. The 11.3 MTPA energy-efficient, environment-friendly, high distillate yielding HMEL complex refinery has been designed to produce high value-added petroleum products catering to a demand-driven market. The company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, HPCL-Mittal Pipelines Ltd, owns and operates the crude oil storage and transportation assets.

      "News Body": "Grappling with soft margins due to unprecedented pressure on decarbonization, India’s crude oil refiners have announced significant investments in petrochemical capacity expansion, aiming to reduce their carbon footprint and bolster revenue streams for future sustainability. These investments are envisaged from both public and private sector investors, amid oversupply and uncertain returns on low-carbon fixtures. The urgency for fresh ideas and innovative solutions continues to drive the need for upgrades.\r\n\r\nMajor petrochemical entities, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd, Indian Oil Corporations Ltd (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Reliance Industries, and Nayara Energy, have committed substantial investments in petrochemical ventures, indicating a move to diversify their portfolios beyond the traditional refining business. These crude oil refiners are now focusing on the production of petrochemical derivatives, such as polymers, for higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a seminar Pankaj Jain, India’s Oil Secretary, stated, “India’s state refiners including BPCL, HPCL, and IOCL, would increasingly focus on boosting conversion ratios from crude oil to petrochemicals to 10-15 percent in the next few years, up from around 4-5 percent at present. The capacity expansion with significant investment aligns with India’s vision of becoming a net exporter of petrochemicals, reflecting the industry’s proactive approach towards sustainable growth.”\r\n\r\nNew start-ups\r\n\r\nCompany\r\n\r\nGrade\r\n\r\nCapacity (‘000 tonnes)\r\n\r\nCommencement\r\n\r\nHPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd\r\n\r\nHDPE\r\n\r\n450\r\n\r\n2023\r\n\r\nNayara Energy\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n450\r\n\r\n2023\r\n\r\nHPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd\r\n\r\nLLDPE/HDPE\r\n\r\n800\r\n\r\n2023\r\n\r\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd\r\n\r\nLLDPE/HDPE\r\n\r\n550\r\n\r\n2024\r\n\r\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd\r\n\r\nLLDPE/HDPE\r\n\r\n550\r\n\r\n2024\r\n\r\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n1,000\r\n\r\n2024\r\n\r\nChennai Petroleum\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n475\r\n\r\n2024\r\n\r\nIndian Oil Corporation\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n450\r\n\r\n2024\r\n\r\nIndian Oil Corporation\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n200\r\n\r\n2025\r\n\r\nGas Authority of India Ltd\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n500\r\n\r\n2025\r\n\r\nHaldia Petrochemicals\r\n\r\nPP\r\n\r\n900\r\n\r\n2028\r\n\r\nSource: Industry\r\n\r\n\r\nCapacity expansions\r\nThe Indian petrochemical industry is planning to add massive production capacities of both polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) based on expectations of a rebound in long-term demand from both domestic and international markets. If implemented according to schedule, these capacity additions will not only reduce India’s dependence on imported petrochemicals but also create an oversupply, leading to price pressure in the near term.\r\n\r\nAccording to reports, India plans to add 2.4 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) of new PE capacities and 3 MMTPA of new PP capacities in the next three years. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture between state-run HPCL and the private company Mittal Energy, is preparing to commence commercial production on its 450,000 tonnes per annum of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) project, in addition to 800,000 tonnes per annum of linear-low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and HDPE capacity. Russia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy is working on a strategy to commercialize 450,000 tonnes per annum of PP production capacity by this month's end.\r\n\r\nThe government-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) proposes to commence two separate projects of LLDPE/HDPE production with capacities operating at 550,000 tonnes per annum each in 2024. Additionally, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd is commencing 1 million tonnes of PP project in 2024. Chennai Petroleum and Indian Oil Corporation have decided to commercialize their PP production capacity of 475,000 tonnes per annum and 450,000 tonnes respectively this year itself.\r\n\r\nIndia’s aggregate petrochemical demand\r\n\r\nFinancial year\r\n\r\nDemand (million tonnes)\r\n\r\nDemand growth (%)\r\n\r\n2024-25(f)\r\n\r\n61\r\n\r\n7.02\r\n\r\n2023-24(f)\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\n7.54\r\n\r\n2022-23\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n8.16\r\n\r\n2021-22\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n13..95\r\n\r\n2020-21\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n(-)8.51\r\n\r\n2019-20\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\n7.00\r\n\r\nSource: Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association (CPMA); (f)=forecast\r\n\r\n\r\nIndian Oil Corporation has yet another project of 200,000 tonnes per annum scheduled for commercialization in 2025. The public sector GAIL India has also proposed to commence a 500,000 tonnes per annum of PP plant in 2025. Additionally, Haldia Petrochemicals’ PP plant with a cumulative capacity of 900,000 tonnes per annum is expected to come on stream in 2028.\r\n\r\nBPCL chairman Krishnakumar Gopalan, said, \"We are aggressive on building refining capacity to cater to the emerging demand in the wake of a robust growth estimated for the Indian economy. Moving ahead responsibly, BPCL will be moving primarily from transportation to petrochemicals and balance capacity increase. Crude oil may have a significant presence in the world until 2050. The biggest challenge for Indian refiners is to continue expansion without compromising on carbon emissions.”\r\n\r\nEchoing a similar response, Prasad Panicker, Head of refineries at Nayara Energy, commented, “We are commencing our maiden journey into the high-growth petrochemicals industry, keeping in mind the vision to transform India into a net exporter. Our expansion project would have a propylene recovery unit/polypropylene unit project at our Vadinar refinery.”\r\n\r\nIndia’s petrochemical production (‘000 tonnes)\r\n\r\nCategories\r\n\r\nFY 2022-23\r\n\r\nFY 2021-22\r\n\r\nVariations (%)\r\n\r\nSynthetic fibre\r\n\r\n4,006.38\r\n\r\n4,040.01\r\n\r\n(-)0.83\r\n\r\nFibre intermediate\r\n\r\n4,988.03\r\n\r\n5,481.67\r\n\r\n(-)9.01\r\n\r\nPolymers\r\n\r\n11,486.62\r\n\r\n12,470.65\r\n\r\n(-)7.89\r\n\r\nSynthetic rubber\r\n\r\n344.86\r\n\r\n382.63\r\n\r\n(-)9.87\r\n\r\nSynthetic detergent intermediates\r\n\r\n703.02\r\n\r\n780.39\r\n\r\n(-)9.91\r\n\r\nPerformance plastics\r\n\r\n1,960.16\r\n\r\n1,697.68\r\n\r\n15.46\r\n\r\nOlefins total\r\n\r\n11,296.05\r\n\r\n12,527.02\r\n\r\n(-)9.83\r\n\r\nSource: Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India\r\n\r\nHPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd was considering adding new capacity to its plant at Bhatinda, Punjab. The move aims to tap into new revenue streams while mitigating the cyclicality inherent in the oil and gas industry. The expansion aligns with India’s vision of becoming a net exporter of petrochemicals, reflecting the industry’s proactive approach towards sustainable growth.\r\n\r\nRobust long-term demand\r\nIndia’s petrochemical demand is projected to rise by 7.5 percent, reaching a record high in the current financial year 2023-24. This growth is attributed to the forecast of robust economic growth fuelled by the government’s massive infrastructure spending and the resurgence of post-pandemic consumer activities. After contracting in the financial year 2020-21 due to pandemic-related disruptions in factories and trade, India’s petrochemical consumption rebounded and outpaced the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP).\r\n\r\nAccording to a report compiled by the apex industry body, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Association of India (CPAI), India’s petrochemical demand is expected to reach 57 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in the financial year 2023-24, compared to 53 MTPA reported in the previous financial year. In the financial year 2024-25, India’s petrochemical demand is forecasted to remain at 61 MTPA. This growth projection signifies an increase in the consumption of petrochemical value chains in the future and a healthy growth rate for the industry.\r\n\r\nExcept for a significant contraction in the financial year 2020-21 due to a slowdown in industrial activities, the overall demand for India’s petrochemicals and raw materials has consistently surpassed the country’s economic growth. According to the recently released report titled ‘Indian Petrochemical Industry 2023’, India’s petrochemical demand declined by 8.5 percent to 43 MTPA in the financial year 2020-21, compared to 47 MTPA in the previous year. India’s National Statistical Office (NSO), under the Government of India, reported a GDP de-growth at (-)6.6 percent (revised from -7.3 percent earlier) for the financial year 2020-21, in contrast to the 4 percent growth recorded in the previous financial year.\r\n\r\nFollowing the de-growth, India’s petrochemical demand gained momentum in the financial year 2021-22, driven by an overall economic recovery and a resurgence in factory activity. As the pandemic’s impact subsided, primary petrochemical and derivative resumed their business activities, coinciding with the recovery in consumer demand. Since then, India’s petrochemical demand for gas consistently surpassed the growth of the country’s economic growth.\r\n\r\nValue-added product demand up\r\nThe report also highlighted that the demand for products in the petrochemical value chain in India is expected to accelerate simultaneously. Polyolefins are projected to witness a growth at 7.7 percent, while surfactants and synthetic rubber are expected to record phenomenal growth rates of 6 percent and 6.1 percent respectively, in the financial year 2023-24. Other key petrochemicals, according to the CPAI report, may also experience a growth of 9 percent in the financial year 2023-24.\r\n\r\nThe leading industry body representing the entire petrochemical industry in India further asserts that the vision for the next five years for this sector is to achieve investment-led growth, primarily driven by the private sector. To accomplish this objective, the government is diligently working on policies to attract investment from both domestic and foreign sources. The work plan includes further liberalizing the direct investment (FDI) policy, simplifying labour laws, enhancing the ease of doing business, implementing power sector reforms, and last improvement in banking, insurance, and pension sectors.\r\n\r\nApart from these, the government’s ongoing efforts to promote economic development in India are the main factor influencing the expansion of the petrochemical industry. The government implemented several initiatives to improve the industry’s overall competitiveness, quality, and output. Initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, and the ‘Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme’ have been implemented to attract domestic manufacturing and facilitate exports.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the industry has taken several measures to promote growth with the introduction of innovative products. These include mandatory standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), public procurement policies for chemicals and petrochemicals, schemes for establishing plastic parks, and adequate support for research and innovation through the establishment of centers of excellence. All these policy initiatives, along with the low cost of manufacturing capital goods and manpower, and the overall demand scenario, are boosting business confidence to plan larger petrochemical complexes in India.\r\n\r\nWith substantial capacity additions planned in both primary production and end-product consumption, the Indian petrochemical industry could witness the implementation of new projects worth approximately US$144 billion (over Rs 10 lakh crore) as the country seeks to bridge the gap between the shortage of domestic supply and the increasing consumer demand.\r\n\r\nRoad ahead\r\nIndia’s annual petrochemical consumption is likely to increase to 80 MMTPA by 2040, forcing the country either to invest immensely in building new capacity or increase imports. Population growth, development, and economic expansion are set to drive the demand. Presently, as Asia’s third-largest economy, India annually consumes around 57 MMTPA of various grades of petrochemicals, with the per capita consumption standing at a third of the global average.",

      "News Intro": "CCI has bought over 19 lakh bales of cotton, 80 per cent from southern India, in the 2023-24 marketing year. Hindered last year by high market prices, CCI is now purchasing at the government's increased MSP. The bulk of the procurement is from Telangana, with significant quantities from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, central, and northern India.",
      "News Body": "The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has procured 19.20 lakh bales of 170 kg cotton to date in the current marketing year 2023-24 (October-September). Industry sources have indicated that the government trading company has procured 80 per cent of its cotton from the southern states. Last year, CCI could not procure a significant quantity of cotton due to higher prices in the open market. \r\n\r\nCCI is purchasing cotton at the minimum support price (MSP) set by the government. It has increased the MSP by around 10 per cent for the current season. The corporation is buying unginned cotton (Kapas) from farmers at ₹6,620 per quintal for medium staple and ₹7,020 per quintal for long staple. \r\n\r\nAccording to sources, CCI has purchased 14.50 lakh bales of cotton from Telangana in the current crop season. Additionally, it has bought 1.12 lakh bales of cotton in Andhra Pradesh and 49,600 bales from Karnataka. In Central India, 94,000 bales of cotton were purchased from Madhya Pradesh, 78,800 bales from Maharashtra, and 15,000 bales from Gujarat. In the northern Indian states, CCI purchased 36,700 bales from Punjab, 32,400 bales from Haryana, and 20,200 bales from Rajasthan. Furthermore, the government has purchased 37,800 bales of cotton from other states in the country, including Odisha. \r\n\r\nCotton prices have eased to near or below the MSP, prompting CCI to step in for the buying of this natural fibre. This trend contrasts with the last season (2022-23), when cotton prices were maintained at much higher levels in the open market, preventing CCI from purchasing significant quantities. \r\n\r\nCCI has procured 80 per cent of its cotton from the southern states, as it could not obtain standard quality cotton in the northern states. Heavy rains in the late monsoon led to pink bollworm disease, which severely affected the quality and yield of cotton in upper Rajasthan and Punjab. CCI had to halt cotton purchases in Punjab due to poor quality. Later, it resumed but adhered to quality standards, which restricted its buying in the northern states.",

      "News Body": "Coal India Ltd. (CIL) is planning to invest about 670 billion rupees ($8 billion) to build coal-fired power plants close to its mines, signaling the fast-growing economy will remain reliant on the fossil fuel for decades to come.\r\n \r\nThe state-owned miner has already won approval for 4.7 gigawatts of generation to be built over the next six to seven years, with most of the facilities to be in the state of Odisha on India’s east coast, Business Development Director Debasish Nanda said in an interview. Another 2 gigawatts are currently under discussion and may take longer to complete, he said.\r\n\r\nThe new power stations are in addition to a plan, announced by New Delhi late last year, to add 88 gigawatts of thermal generation capacity through 2032. The world’s most populous country is forecasting electricity demand to surge over the next few years, making it tough to wean itself off coal, which accounts for around three-quarters of the power mix.\r\n\r\nThe fossil fuel will remain relevant to the country’s electricity mix for at least three decades, Nanda said. Putting these plants near mines will allow the company to avoid transport costs, keeping them competitive, he said, adding that Coal India is also looking to build renewable power stations and get into mining critical minerals.\r\n\r\nIndia has a goal of getting to net zero by 2070, later than other major economies, reflecting the fact that both its population and economy are still growing quickly. However, environmentalists say the government should be doing more to decarbonize the power system.\r\n“Coal is already unsustainable on the four key parameters of climate, environment, social justice and economics,” said Sunil Dahiya, a New Delhi-based analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. “The government needs to form policies that allow wise use of resources, instead of burdening the power system and the economy with expensive coal-fired electricity.”\r\n",

      "News Body": "In a significant development, state-run NTPC will soon procure one million tonnes (mt) of thermal coal from commercial miners on a delivered basis, a development that can help create a reliable and cost-effective supply chain for the critical resource, which accounts for over 70 per cent of India’s power generation.\r\n\r\nPlayUnmute\r\nFullscreen\r\n\r\nAlso read: Charged up NTPC stock hits yet another peak\r\nSources said the country’s largest power generator will procure 1 mt coal from commercial mines. It was finalised last month and a tender for the same will be floated soon, which will be on a delivered basis. If the arrangement works out, more quantities will be procured from the private sector. This will help reduce imports by the power sector.\r\n\r\n“Commercial miners are keen to supply coal to the power sector on a delivered basis. It’s a win-win. Consumers will get coal at plant head on an assured and cost competitive basis, while miners will get a market. This also helps consuming sectors, who in times of peak demand season have to procure coal at higher prices through e-auctions,” explained one of the sources.\r\n\r\nIn March this year, Coal Secretary Amrit Lal Meena told businessline, “With wider contributions from captive and commercial mines, the availability of coal to users will be better. Resultantly, pressure on CIL coal auctions will reduce. Hence, the premium on auction will go down and coal will be cheaper for consumers. This, in turn, will help reduce cost of production for all coal-based industries.”\r\n\r\nDiversifying sources\r\nAnother source said that if the arrangement between NTPC and the miner works out then in the medium to long term, India can have a robust commercial coal market with competitive pricing strategies. This will also reduce the dominance of state-run Coal India, which currently accounts for almost 90 per cent of India’s production of the dry fuel.\r\n\r\n“If this works out, then in the medium to long term, it can alter the contours of fuel supply agreements (FSAs) and to some extent the power purchase agreements (PPAs) as power producers will have various options to procure the fuel at competitive prices,” a top state power department official said.\r\n\r\nSiddartha Keshavadasu, Associate Director (Power Advisory) at Nangia & Co, pointed out that diversifying coal sources is a strategic move for NTPC, aiming for a more reliable and cost-effective fuel supply.\r\n\r\n“By sourcing from commercial mines, NTPC can reduce coal costs and enhance power generation efficiency. This introduces competition in the traditionally CIL-dominated market, potentially leading to better pricing and service quality. While CIL has been a key player in India’s coal industry, alternative suppliers will introduce market competitiveness and incentivise CIL to adopt more efficient practices,” he added.\r\n\r\nResilient supply chain\r\nIn the long term, Keshavadasu opined that the strategy promotes a resilient coal supply chain, mitigating risks of supply disruptions and price volatility. Regulatory oversight will be crucial to maintain fair pricing and market stability, ensuring any price escalations are controlled.\r\n\r\n“NTPC’s initiative reflects a shift towards market-driven approaches in the energy sector, promising cost savings and a robust power generation landscape. This development underscores the evolving nature of the coal market and the ongoing efforts to optimize fuel procurement practices in the power sector,” he added.\r\n\r\nCommercial coal block auctions were launched in June 2020. Since then, nine rounds have taken place, and the 10th round was launched in June 2024. So far, 107 coal blocks with 256 mt peak rated capacity have been auctioned, of which 11 blocks have been operationalised. During FY24, 17.5 mt coal was produced from such blocks.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative coal production from captive and commercial mines rose by a healthy 27 per cent Y-o-Y to hit a record 147.2 mt in FY24. The Coal Ministry aims to enhance the production by around 20 per cent in FY25.\r\n\r\n",

      "News Body": "Coal India Limited (CIL) in a bid to tap the latent coal reserves of some of its closed and discontinued underground mines has awarded 23 such mines on revenue sharing model to successful bidders of the private sector. The cumulative peak rated capacity of is 34.14 million tonnes/year (MT/Y) while the total extractable reserves are estimated at 635 MT. Earlier, CIL had identified a total of 34 discontinued mines where good quality coal reserves are lying dormant but may not be financially viable for CIL to mine them. CIL has decided to tender and offer these mines to willing private sector players who are prepared to operate and produce the dry fuel and share part of the revenue with CIL. Successful bidder is the one who offers the maximum revenue to the authority, which is the coal company. The minimum revenue to be shared is 4%. The contract period is for a maximum of 25 years. The advantages are conservation of resource, effective substitution of imported coal for non-regulated sector with good quality coal locked up in these mines and provision of livelihood to the local communities where these mines are revived. From environmental point of view there would be no land degradation as the mining infrastructure is already in place. CIL is also identifying few more mines for the purpose to attract wider participation with bid norms relaxed. On the total quantity of coal sold exclusively for coal gasification or coal liquefaction purpose in a year, a 50% on contracted percentage of revenue share of the authority will be provided to the operator. The successful bidder or the mine operator to who the mine shall be handed over on “as is where is” basis, can also utilize the existing infrastructure and project facilities without any additional payment to the authority. In case of a consortium foreign bidders are allowed to participate as second or third members of the consortium, as per Government e Marketplace (GeM) portal. The mine operator shall act as the agency responsible for selling coal mined from these mines at market driven price through an auction process on behalf of the authority. They shall have the freedom to adopt their preferential method of technology and deployment of mining machinery to extract coal from the mines. Of the 34 identified mines, the West Bengal based Eastern Coalfields Limited and Jharkhand based Bharat Coking Coal Limited account for 10 each. Western Coalfields Limited -5, South Eastern Coalfields Limited -4, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited -3 and Central Coalfields Limited 2 add up the remaining.",

This will make use of the huge existing infrastructure and require less new investments as compared to other decarbonisation options. Furthermore, as in India coal is the only widely available option for baseload power generation, it will help to reduce the carbon footprint of this source of reliable power, for decades in future.\r\n\r\nAs a primary goal, the collaboration is to support NTPC in co-firing of biomass pellets beyond 20% and up to 100%, as well as enabling the co-firing of methanol. It will also explore the possibility of introducing ammonia as a co-firing fuel, and develop, test and demonstrate technologies that allow a total co-firing with lower carbon fuels in coal fired power plants.\r\n\r\nNTPC Limited and GE Power India Limited sign MoU to reduce carbon intensity from NTPC’s coal fired units\r\n\r\nUjjwal Kanti Bhattacharya, Director Projects, NTPC Limited said, “We are looking forward to working with GE Power India Limited as NTPC intends to minimize the carbon footprint of our 57+ GW coal-based units. We aim to decrease carbon footprint from our coal fired power plants by co-firing of alternative fuels such as carbon neutral fuel, Green Methanol and Green Ammonia. It will support our goal of reducing carbon emissions from our coal-based power generation, as part of NTPC’s The Brighter Plan 2032 that aims at setting new benchmarks in sustainability along the entire energy value chain in India.”\r\n\r\nPrashant Jain, MD GE Power India Limited and RGM GE Steam Power said, “This MOU is in line with our country’s efforts to adopt advanced powering technology to decarbonize power generation.
